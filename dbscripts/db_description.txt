The subfolders contains two different setups for 2 different reproducible(=time sensitive) IR-ranking approaches
First approach is a lightweight database, where the tf-idf values are being calculated within the IR retrieval/querie and the validity time frame is only stored in the document table.
The second approach adds timestamp and tf-idf values to the dict table which should reduce processing time for a trade off in storage consumption.

Scenariopath Nr 1 (sc1)

Consists of three tables dict, terms and docs

1) dict contains all distinct terms that are used in all documents. 

			  dict
|-------------------------------|
|	tid	(PK)	|		term	|
|_______________|_______________|

2) table terms maps the dict entries to the documents and also states the position of the terms in the document

			  terms
|-----------------------------------------------|
|	tid	(PK)	|	did	(PK)	|		pos		|
|_______________|_______________|_______________|

3) table documents stores information about the document including the time it was added and removed (if it was at all), the documentid is generated ascending

			  docs
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|	did	(PK)	|		name	|		pageid	|		revid	|		added	|		rem		|		len		|
|_______________|_______________|_______________|_______________|_______________|_______________|_______________|


Scenariopath Nr 2 (sc2)

Also consists of three tables dict, terms and docs

1) in addition to the dict table in scenario 1, an addtional table provides information about the updates on the dict terms and holds the values for the document frequency

			  dict
|-------------------------------|
|	tid (PK)	|		term	|
|_______________|_______________|


			dict_hist
			
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|	tid	(PK)	|		added	|		rem		|		df		|
|_______________|_______________|_______________|_______________|		
			
			

2) the table terms get the tf value assigned additionally / the pos column may be unused or dropped

			  terms
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|
|	tid	(PK)	|	did	(PK)	|		pos		|		tf		|
|_______________|_______________|_______________|_______________|

3) the table terms remains unchanged to scenario 1

			  docs
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|	did	(PK)	|		name	|		pageid	|		revid	|		added	|		rem		|		len		|
|_______________|_______________|_______________|_______________|_______________|_______________|_______________|
