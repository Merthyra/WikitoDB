'''The Act of Settlement''' is an [[Acts of the Parliament of England|Act]] of the [[Parliament of England]] that was passed in 1701&lt;ref&gt;The act received Royal Assent in 1701. However, it is formally dated as 1700 in official use, such as the listing for the act in the ''[[Chronological Table of the Statutes]]'', because acts passed before the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]] came into force are dated by the year in which the relevant parliamentary session began, which, in this case, was 1700 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]).&lt;/ref&gt; to settle the [[Order of succession|succession]] to the [[List of English monarchs|English]] and [[List of Irish monarchs|Irish]] crowns and thrones on the [[Electress]] [[Sophia of Hanover]] (a granddaughter of [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland and I of England]]) and her non-[[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] heirs. Her mother, Princess Elizabeth Stuart, had been  born in Scotland but became famous in history as [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]].

The act was prompted by the failure of [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]], as well as of Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], to produce any surviving children, and the [[Roman Catholic]] religion of all other members of the [[House of Stuart]]. The line of Sophia of Hanover was the most junior among the Stuarts, but consisted of convinced Protestants. Sophia died on 8 June 1714, before the death of Queen Anne on 1 August 1714, at which time Sophia's son duly became [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] and started the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian dynasty]].

The act played a key role in the formation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. England and Scotland had [[Union of the Crowns|shared a monarch]] since 1603, but had remained separately governed countries. The [[Scottish Parliament (pre-1707)|Scottish parliament]] was more reluctant than the [[English Parliament|English]] to abandon the House of Stuart, members of which had been [[Scottish monarchs]] long before they became [[English monarchs|English ones]]. English pressure on Scotland to accept the Act of Settlement was one factor leading to the [[Acts of Union 1707|parliamentary union of the two countries]] in 1707.

Under the Act of Settlement anyone who becomes a Roman Catholic, or who marries one, becomes disqualified to inherit the throne. The act also placed limits on both the role of foreigners in the British government and the power of the monarch with respect to the Parliament of England, though some of those provisions have been altered by subsequent legislation.

Along with the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the Act of Settlement remains today one of the main constitutional laws governing the [[Line of succession to the British Throne|succession]] not only to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|throne of the United Kingdom]], but to those of the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, whether by assumption or by [[patriation]].&lt;ref name=Topo&gt;{{cite journal| last=Toporoski| first=Richard| title=The Invisible Crown| journal=Monarchy Canada| issue=Summer 1998| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| year=1998| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| accessdate=16 May 2009| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080209220704/http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| archivedate=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act of Settlement cannot be altered in any realm except by that realm's own parliament and, by [[Convention (norm)#Government|convention]], only with the consent of all the other realms, as it touches on the succession to the [[Commonwealth realm#The Crown in the Commonwealth realms|shared crown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK |type=act |year=1931 |chapter=4 |act=The Statute of Westminster 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original documents are deposited in the Lower Saxon State Archives in Hanover, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lower Saxon State Archives, Hanover (HStAH), Cal. Or. 63, 1 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Original context==
Following the [[Glorious Revolution]], the line of succession to the English throne was governed by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], which declared that the flight of [[James II of England|James II]] from England to France during the revolution amounted to an [[abdication]] of the throne and that James' son-in-law and nephew&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siena.edu/uploadedfiles/home/parents_and_community/community_page/sri/independent_research/Presidents%20Release_2010_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[William III of England|William of Orange]], and his wife, James' daughter, [[Mary II of England|Mary]], were James' successors, who ruled jointly as [[William and Mary|William III and Mary II]]. The Bill of Rights also provided that the line of succession would go through their descendants, then through Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne]], and her descendants, and then to the issue of William III by a later marriage (if he were to marry again after the death of Mary II). During the debate, the House of Lords had attempted to append Sophia and her descendants to the line of succession, but the amendment failed in the Commons.&lt;ref name=melville&gt;{{cite book|last=Melville|first=Lewis|title=The First George in Hanover and England|year=1908|publisher=Isaac Pitman and Sons|location=London|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary II died childless in 1694, after which William III did not remarry. In 1700, [[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]], who was the only child of Princess Anne to survive infancy, died of a fever at the age of 11. Thus, Anne was left as the last remaining legal heir to the throne. The Bill of Rights excluded Catholics from the throne, which ruled out James II and his descendants. However, it also provided for no further succession after Anne. Parliament thus saw the need to settle the succession on Sophia and her descendants, and thereby guarantee the continuity of the Crown in the Protestant line.

==Provisions==
The Act of Settlement provided that the throne would pass to the [[Sophia of Hanover|Electress Sophia of Hanover]]&amp;nbsp;– a granddaughter of [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland and I of England]], niece of [[Charles I of England|Charles I of Scotland and England]]&amp;nbsp;– and her [[Protestantism|Protestant]] descendants who had not married a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]; those who were Roman Catholic, and those who married a Roman Catholic, were barred from ascending the throne &quot;for ever&quot;. Eight additional provisions of the act would only come into effect upon the death of both William and Anne:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/1700/1565208.html |title=Act of Settlement 1700 |publisher=[[British and Irish Legal Information Institute|BAILII]] |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The monarch &quot;shall join in communion with the [[Church of England]].&quot; This was intended to avoid a Roman Catholic monarch. Along with James II's perceived despotism, his religion was the main cause of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and the previous linked religious and succession problems which had been resolved by the joint monarchy of [[William and Mary]].
* If a person not native to England comes to the throne, England will not wage war for &quot;any dominions or territories which do not belong to the Crown of England, without the consent of Parliament.&quot; This was far-sighted, because when a member of the [[House of Hanover]] ascended the British throne, he would retain the territories of the [[Kingdom of Hanover|Electorate of Hanover]] (in what is now [[Lower Saxony]]). This provision has been dormant since [[Queen Victoria]] ascended the throne, because she did not inherit Hanover under the [[Salic Law]]s of the German states.
* No monarch may leave &quot;the dominions of [[England]], [[Scotland]], or [[Ireland]],&quot; without the consent of Parliament. This provision was repealed in 1716, at the request of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], who was also the [[prince-elector|Elector of Hanover]] and Duke of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; because of this and also for personal reasons he wished to visit Hanover occasionally.&lt;ref name=tarkowp547&gt;{{cite journal |last=Naamani Tarkow |first=I. |year=1943 |title= The Significance of the Act of Settlement in the Evolution of English Democracy |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=537–561 at p. 547 |doi=10.2307/2144947}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* All government matters within the jurisdiction of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] were to be transacted there, and all council resolutions were to be signed by those who advised and consented to them. This was because Parliament wanted to know who was deciding policies, as sometimes councillors' signatures normally attached to resolutions were absent. This provision was repealed early in Queen Anne's reign, as many councillors ceased to offer advice and some stopped attending meetings altogether.&lt;ref name=tarkowp547 /&gt;
* No foreigner, even if naturalised (unless born of English parents) shall be allowed to be a Privy Councillor or a member of either House of Parliament, or hold &quot;any office or place of trust, either civil or military, or to have any grant of lands, tenements or hereditaments from the Crown, to himself or to any other or others in trust for him.&quot; Subsequent nationality laws made naturalised citizens the equal of those native born, and this provision no longer applies.
* No person who has an office under the monarch, or receives a pension from the Crown, can be a Member of Parliament (MP). This provision was inserted to avoid unwelcome royal influence over the House of Commons. It remains in force, but with several exceptions. (As a side effect, this provision means that MPs seeking to resign from parliament can get round the age-old prohibition on resignation by obtaining a [[sinecure]] in the control of the Crown; while several offices have historically been used for this purpose, two are currently in use: appointments generally alternate between the stewardships of the [[Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds|Chiltern Hundreds]] and of the [[Steward of the Manor of Northstead|Manor of Northstead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P11.pdf |work=House of Commons Information Office |title=The Chiltern Hundreds |date=1 June 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Judges' commissions are valid ''quamdiu se bene gesserint'' (during good behaviour) and if they do not behave themselves, they can be removed only by both Houses of Parliament, or the one House of Parliament, depending on the legislature's structure. This provision was the result of various monarchs influencing judges' rulings, and its purpose was to assure [[judicial independence]].
* No pardon by the monarch can save someone from being [[Impeachment|impeached]] by the House of Commons.

==Effects==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
For different reasons, various [[constitutionalist]]s have praised the Act of Settlement: [[Henry Hallam]] called the Act &quot;the seal of our constitutional laws&quot; and [[David Lindsay Keir]] placed its importance above the Bill of Rights of 1689.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tarkow, p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt; Naamani Tarkow has written: &quot;If one is to make sweeping statements, one may say that, save [[Magna Carta]] (more truly, its implications), the Act of Settlement is probably the most significant statute in English history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tarkow, p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt;{{explain}}

===Kingdom of Great Britain===
[[Image:Act of Settlement 3323.jpg|thumb|left|Facsimile of the Act of Settlement sent to Electress Sophia of Hanover]]
[[Image:Sophie von der Pfalz als Indianerin.jpg|thumb|left|''Sophia of the Palatine, later Electress of Hanover''; portrait by her sister, Louise Hollandine, c. 1644]]

The Act of Settlement was, in many ways, the major cause of the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] of [[Scotland]] with [[England and Wales]] to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] was not happy with the Act of Settlement and, in response, passed the [[Act of Security]] in 1704, through which Scotland reserved the right to choose its own successor to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. Stemming from this, the Parliament of England decided that, to ensure the stability and future prosperity of Great Britain, full union of the two parliaments and nations was essential before Anne's death.

It used a combination of exclusionary legislation (the [[Alien Act of 1705]]), politics, and [[bribery]] to achieve this within three years under the [[Act of Union 1707]]. This success was in marked contrast to the four attempts at political union between 1606 and 1689, which all failed owing to a lack of political will in both kingdoms. By virtue of Article II of the [[Treaty of Union]], which defined the succession to the throne of Great Britain, the Act of Settlement became part of [[Scots Law]] as well.

===Succession to the Crown===
In addition to [[James II of England|James II]] (who died a few months after the Act received the royal assent) and his Roman Catholic children [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Prince James]] and the [[Louisa Maria Teresa Stuart|Princess Royal]], the Act also excluded the descendants of King James's sister [[Princess Henrietta of England|Henrietta]], the youngest daughter of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Henrietta's daughter [[Anne Marie d'Orléans|Anne]] was then the Queen of Sardinia and a Roman Catholic; subsequent [[Jacobite succession|Jacobite pretenders]] are descended from her.

With the legitimate descendants of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] either childless (in the case of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]) or Roman Catholic, Parliament's choice was limited to the Protestant descendants of [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]], the only other child of [[James I of England|King James I]] not to have died in childhood. Elizabeth had borne nine children who reached adulthood, of whom [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia]] was the ''youngest''. In 1701, in favour of Sophia, Parliament passed over senior living representatives of lines which included [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine|Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orléans]], [[Louis Otto, Prince of Salm]] and his sisters, [[Anne Henriette of Bavaria|Anne Henriette, Princess of Condé]], [[Benedicta Henrietta of the Palatinate|Benedicta Henrietta, Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], and Sophia's sister [[Louise Hollandine of the Palatinate]].

===Removal from the succession due to Catholicism===
Since the Act's passing the most senior living member of the Royal Family to have married a Roman Catholic, and thereby to have been removed from the line of succession, is [[Prince Michael of Kent]], who married [[Princess Michael of Kent|Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz]] in 1978; he was fifteenth in the line of succession at the time. He was restored to the line of succession in 2015 when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] came into force, and became 34th in line.&lt;ref name=royalcentral&gt;{{cite web |url=http://royalcentral.co.uk/state/what-do-the-new-royal-succession-changes-mean-46610 |title=What do the new royal succession changes mean? |publisher=Royal Central |date=26 March 2015 |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next most senior living descendant of the Electress Sophia who had been ineligible to succeed on this ground is [[George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews]], the eldest son of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], who married the Roman Catholic [[Sylvana Windsor, Countess of St Andrews|Sylvana Palma Tomaselli]] in 1988. His son, [[Edward Windsor, Lord Downpatrick|Lord Downpatrick]], converted to Roman Catholicism in 2003 and is the most senior descendant of Sophia to be barred as a result of his religion. More recently, [[Peter Phillips]], the son of [[Anne, Princess Royal]], and eleventh in line to the throne, married [[Autumn Phillips|Autumn Kelly]]; Kelly had been brought up as a Roman Catholic, but she converted to [[Anglicanism]] prior to the wedding. Had she not done so, Phillips would have forfeited his place in the succession upon their marriage.

Excluding those princesses who have married into Roman Catholic royal families, such as [[Marie of Romania|Marie of Edinburgh]], [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] and [[Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh]], one member of the Royal Family (that is, with the style of ''[[Royal Highness]]'') has converted to Roman Catholicism since the passage of the Act: the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]], wife of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]] who converted on 14 January 1994, but her husband did not lose his place in the succession because she was an Anglican at the time of their marriage.{{fact|date=January 2015}}

===The abdication of Edward VIII===
Under the Act of Settlement, [[male-preference primogeniture]] succession of an Anglican legitimate descendant of the Electress Sophia is automatic and immediate, neither depending on, nor waiting for, any proclamation. Thus, during the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis]] of 1936, caused by [[Edward VIII]]'s desire to marry [[Wallis Simpson]], the consent of all realms, along with, in some cases, new acts of parliament, was required to allow for Edward's stepping aside and the exclusion of any potential children of his marriage. In the United Kingdom, [[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936|His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act]] was, with the consent of the [[Australia]]n, [[Canada|Canadian]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Union of South Africa|South African]] governments, passed through Parliament; and the Crown thus passed to the next-in-line descendant of Sophia: Edward's brother, [[George VI|Prince Albert, Duke of York]]. The [[Irish Free State]] legislated independently. To formalise its government's consent to the abdication, the [[Parliament of Canada|Canadian parliament]] passed, the following year, the [[Succession to the Throne Act]] (1 Geo. VI, c.16) and South Africa took a similar course of action.

==Present status==
In the Australian Capital Territory, the Act of Settlement was, on 11 May 1989, converted, from an act of the Parliament of England into an ACT enactment, by section 34(4) of the [[Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988]] (Cwlth), and then renamed ''The Act of Settlement 1700'' by the Legislation Act 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/a/db_1788/current/pdf/db_1788.pdf |title=Act of Settlement 1700 |format=PDF |publisher=ACT Government |work=ACT Legislation Register}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendment proposals==
Challenges have been made against the Act of Settlement, especially its provisions regarding Roman Catholics and [[Primogeniture|preference for males]]. However, legislating for alterations to the Act is a complex process, since the Act is a common denominator in the shared succession of all the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] acknowledges by established convention that any changes to the rules of succession may be made only with the agreement of all of the states involved, with concurrent amendments to be made by each state's parliament or parliaments. Further, as the current monarch's eldest child and, in turn, his eldest child, are Anglican males, any change to the succession laws would have no immediate implications. Consequently, there was little public concern with the issues and debate had been confined largely to academic circles until, in November 2010, the announcement that [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] was [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|to marry]]. This raised the question of what would happen if he were to produce first a daughter and then a son.

''[[The Times]]'' reported on 6 November 1995 that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] had said on that day to [[Tony Blair]] and [[Paddy Ashdown]] that &quot;Catholics should be able to ascend to the British throne&quot;. Ashdown claimed the Prince said: &quot;I really can't think why we can't have Catholics on the throne&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=| first=| title=none| newspaper=The Times| date=6 November 1995| url=| accessdate=}}{{full|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, during debate on a [[Succession to the Crown Bill]], Junior Home Office Minister [[Gareth Williams, Baron Williams of Mostyn|Lord Williams of Mostyn]] informed the [[House of Lords]] that the Queen had &quot;no objection to the Government's view that in determining the line of succession to the throne, daughters and sons should be treated in the same way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/politics/60808.stm |title=Queen backs historic change to who may rule |publisher=BBC News |date=27 February 1998 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In October 2011 the [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] was reported to have reached an agreement with all of [[States and territories of Australia|the states]] on potential changes to their laws in the wake of amendments to the Act of Settlement.&lt;ref name=Coorey2011-10-29&gt;{{cite news| last=Coorey| first=Phillip| title=Leaders abandon rule on male heir succession| url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/leaders-abandon-rule-on-male-heir-succession-20111028-1mo9q.html| date=29 October 2011| newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald| accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of the Australian states—for example, New South Wales and Victoria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| publication-date=1969| title=Imperial Acts Application Act 1969| series=6| publication-place=Sydney| publisher=New South Wales Government Printer| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/iaaa1969240/| accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| publication-date=1980| title=Imperial Acts Act 1980| series=6| publication-place=Melbourne| publisher=Government Printer| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/iaaa1980240/| accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—has been, when legislating to repeal some imperial statutes so far as they still applied in Australia, to provide that imperial statutes concerning the royal succession remain in force.

The legal process required at the federal level remains unclear. The [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]], as was noted during the crisis of 1936, contains no power for the federal parliament to legislate with respect to the monarchy.&lt;ref name=Twomey&gt;[[#Twomey|Twomey]], pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Everything thus turns upon the status and meaning of clause 2 in the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, which provides: &quot;The provisions of this Act referring to the Queen shall extend to Her Majesty's heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Victoria| author-link=Queen Victoria| publication-date=1901| title=Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900| series=2| publication-place=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00469| accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Twomey reviews three possible interpretations of the clause.&lt;ref name=Twomey /&gt; First: it &quot;mandates that whoever is the sovereign of the United Kingdom is also, by virtue of this external fact, sovereign of Australia&quot;; accordingly, changes to British succession laws would have no effect on Australian law, but if the British amendment changed the sovereign, then the new sovereign of the United Kingdom would automatically become the new [[Monarchy of Australia|sovereign of Australia]]. Second, it is &quot;merely an interpretative provision&quot;, operating to ensure that references to &quot;the Queen&quot; in the Constitution are references to whoever may at the time be the incumbent of the &quot;sovereignty of the United Kingdom&quot; as determined with regard to Australia, following the [[Australia Act 1986]], by Australian law. Or, third, it incorporates the United Kingdom rules of succession into the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, which itself can now be altered only by Australia, according to the [[Australia Act 1986]]; in that way, the British rules of succession have been patriated to Australia and, with regard to Australia, are subject to amendment or repeal solely by Australian law. However, Twomey expresses confidence that, if the [[High Court of Australia]] were to be faced with the problems of covering clause 2, it would find some way to conclude that, with regard to Australia, the clause is subject solely to Australian law.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Twomey|Twomey]], pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian scholar Richard Toporoski theorised in 1998 that &quot;if, let us say, an alteration were to be made in the United Kingdom to the Act of Settlement 1701, providing for the succession of the Crown... [i]t is my opinion that the domestic constitutional law of Australia or Papua New Guinea, for example, would provide for the succession in those countries of the same person who became Sovereign of the United Kingdom.&quot;&lt;ref name=Topo /&gt;

In [[Canada]], where the Act of Settlement is now a part of [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitutional law]], [[Tony O'Donohue]], a Canadian civic politician, took issue with the provisions that exclude [[Roman Catholic]]s from the throne, and which make the [[Monarchy of Canada|monarch of Canada]] the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], requiring him or her to be an [[Church of England|Anglican]]. This, he claimed, discriminated against non-Anglicans, including Catholics, who are the largest faith group in Canada.&lt;ref name=Spector&gt;{{cite news| url=http://members.shaw.ca/nspector3/globe302.htm| first=Norman| last=Spector| title=Why Canada must take on Britain over the 1701 Act of Settlement| date=30 August 2007| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, O'Donohue launched [[O'Donohue v.

Also, the court noted that, while Canada has the power to amend the line of succession to the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian throne]], the Statute of Westminster stipulates that the agreement of the governments of the fifteen other Commonwealth realms that share the Crown would first have to be sought if Canada wished to continue its relationship with these countries. An appeal of the decision was dismissed on 16 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=O'Donohue v. Canada|link=O'Donohue v.

With the announcement in 2007 of the [[engagement]] of [[Peter Phillips]] to [[Autumn Phillips|Autumn Kelly]], a Roman Catholic and a Canadian, discussion about the Act of Settlement was revived. [[Norman Spector]] called in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' for [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] to address the issue of the Act's bar on Catholics, saying that Phillips' marriage to Kelly would be the first time the provisions of the act would bear directly on Canada—Phillips would be barred from acceding to the Canadian throne because he married a Roman Catholic Canadian.&lt;ref name=Spector /&gt; (In fact, [[George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews|the Earl of St. Andrews]] had already lost his place in the line of succession when he married the Roman Catholic Canadian [[Sylvana Windsor, Countess of St Andrews|Sylvana Palma Tomaselli]] in 1988, but St. Andrews' place in the line of succession was significantly lower than Phillips'.) Criticism of the Act of Settlement due to the Phillips-Kelly marriage was muted when Autumn Kelly converted to Anglicanism shortly before her marriage, thus preserving her husband's place in the line of succession.

From time to time there has been debate over repealing the clause that prevents Roman Catholics, or those who marry one, from ascending to the British throne. Proponents of repeal argue that the clause is a bigoted [[anachronism]]; [[Thomas Winning|Cardinal Winning]], who was leader of the Roman Catholic Church in [[Scotland]], called the act an &quot;insult&quot; to Catholics. [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor|Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor]], the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England, pointed out that Prince William (later the Duke of Cambridge) &quot;can marry by law a [[Hindu]], a [[Buddhist]], anyone, but not a Roman Catholic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2021615.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Let monarchy marry Catholics | date=2 June 2002 | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of repeal, such as [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Adrian Hilton]], believe that it would lead to the disestablishment of the Church of England as the state religion if a Roman Catholic were to come to the throne. They also note that the monarch must swear to defend the faith and be a member of the [[Anglican Communion]], but that a Roman Catholic monarch would, like all Roman Catholics, owe allegiance to the Pope. This would, according to opponents of repeal, amount to a loss of [[sovereignty]] for the Anglican Church.

When in December 1978 there was media speculation that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] might marry a Roman Catholic, Powell defended the provision that excludes Roman Catholics from ascending the throne, claiming his objection was not rooted in religious bigotry but in political considerations. He stated a Roman Catholic monarch would mean the acceptance of a source of authority external to the realm and &quot;in the literal sense, foreign to the [[Queen-in-Parliament|Crown-in-Parliament]]... Between Roman Catholicism and [[royal supremacy]] there is, as St [[Thomas More]] concluded, no reconciliation&quot;. Powell concluded that a Roman Catholic crown would be the destruction of the Church of England because &quot;it would contradict the essential character of that church&quot;.

He continued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When [[Thomas Hobbes]] wrote that &quot;the Papacy is no other than the ghost of the deceased [[Roman Empire]] sitting crowned upon the grave thereof&quot;, he was promulgating an enormously important truth. Authority in the Roman Church is the exertion of that ''imperium'' from which England in the 16th century finally and decisively declared its national independence as the ''alter imperium'', the &quot;other empire&quot;, of which [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] declared &quot;This realm of England is an empire&quot; ... It would signal the beginning of the end of the British monarchy. It would portend the eventual surrender of everything that has made us, and keeps us still, a nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Like the Roman: The Life of Enoch Powell |last=Heffer |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Heffer |year=1999 |publisher=Phoenix Giant |location=London |isbn=0-7538-0820-X |page= |pages=810–812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Scottish Parliament]] unanimously passed a motion in 1999 calling for the complete removal of any discrimination linked to the monarchy and the repeal of the Act of Settlement.&lt;ref name=Scotsman2011&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/catholics_still_barred_from_throne_despite_law_change_1_1937348| title=Catholics still barred from throne despite law change| date=28 October 2011| newspaper=The Scotsman| accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, ''[[The Guardian]]'' challenged the succession law in court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/dec/06/monarchy.claredyer| last=Dyer| first=Clare| title=A Challenge to the Crown: now is the time for change| date=6 December 2000| newspaper=The Guardian| accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that it violated the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which provides,
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;As the Convention nowhere lists the right to succeed to the Crown as a human right, the challenge was rejected.

[[Adrian Hilton]], writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in 2003, defended the Act of Settlement as not &quot;irrational prejudice or blind bigotry,&quot; but claimed that it was passed because &quot;the nation had learnt that when a Roman Catholic monarch is upon the throne, religious and civil liberty is lost.&quot; He points to the Pope's claiming universal jurisdiction, and Hilton argues that &quot;it would be intolerable to have, as the sovereign of a Protestant and free country, one who owes any allegiance to the head of any other state&quot; and contends that, if such situation came about, &quot;we will have undone centuries of common law.&quot; He said that because the Roman Catholic Church [[Apostolicae curae|does not recognise]] the Church of England as an apostolic church, a Roman Catholic monarch who abided by their faith's doctrine would be obliged to view Anglican and [[Church of Scotland]] archbishops, bishops, and clergy as part of the [[laity]] and therefore &quot;lacking the ordained authority to preach and celebrate the sacraments.&quot; (Hilton noted that the Church of Scotland's [[Presbyterian polity]] does not include bishops or archbishops.) Hilton said a Roman Catholic monarch would be unable to be crowned by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and notes that other European states have similar religious provisions for their monarchs: [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]], whose constitutions compel their monarchs to be [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]; the [[Netherlands]], which has a constitution requiring its monarchs be members of the Protestant [[House of Orange]]; and [[Belgium]], which has a constitution that provides for the succession to be through Roman Catholic houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200311/ai_n9341744| last=Hilton| first=Adrian| title=The price of liberty |newspaper=The Spectator| date=8 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2004, a private member's bill—the [[Succession to the Crown Bill 2004|Succession to the Crown Bill]]—was introduced in the House of Lords. The government, headed by [[Tony Blair]], blocked all attempts to revise the succession laws, claiming it would raise too many constitutional issues and it was unnecessary at the time. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|British general election]] the following year, [[Michael Howard]] promised to work towards having the prohibition removed if the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] gained a majority of seats in the House of Commons, but the election was won by Blair's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Four years later, plans drawn up by [[Chris Bryant]] were revealed that would end the exclusion of Catholics from the throne and end the doctrine of agnatic (male-preference) [[primogeniture]] in favour of absolute primogeniture, which governs succession solely on birth order and not on sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1| last=Wintour| first=Patrick| title=End of the Anglican crown – 300 year bar to be lifted| date=25 September 2008| newspaper=The Guardian| accessdate=25 September 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080926085427/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1| archivedate= 26 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was raised again in January 2009, when a private members bill to amend the Act of Succession was introduced in parliament.

In early 2011 [[Keith Vaz]], a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Member of Parliament, introduced to the House of Commons at Westminster a [[private member's bill]] which proposed that the Act of Settlement be amended to remove the provisions relating to Roman Catholicism and change the primogeniture governing the line of succession to the British throne from [[agnatic primogeniture|agnatic]] to [[Absolute cognatic primogeniture|absolute cognatic]]. Vaz sought support for his project from the Canadian Cabinet and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]], but the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|Office of the Prime Minister of Canada]] responded that the issue was &quot;not a priority for the government or for Canadians without further elaboration on the merits or drawbacks of the proposed reforms.&quot; [[Stephenson King]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Saint Lucia|Prime Minister of Saint Lucia]], said he supported the idea and it was reported that the government of New Zealand did, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Cecil| first=Nicholas| title=St Lucia backs change to laws of succession| newspaper=London Evening Standard| date=8 March 2011| url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23929938-st-lucia-backs-change-to-laws-of-succession.do| accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Monarchist League of Canada]] said at the time to the media that it &quot;supports amending the Act of Settlement in order to modernize the succession rules.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Boswell| first=Randy| title=Brit asks Canada for help rewriting the rules of the Crown| newspaper=Vancouver Sun| date=21 January 2011| url=http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Brit+asks+Canada+help+rewriting+rules+Crown/4146719/story.html| accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the same year, the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, [[Nick Clegg]], announced that the government was considering a change in the law.&lt;ref name=BBC2009&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7841414.stm |title=Fresh bid to reform monarchy law| date=21 January 2009| work=BBC| accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13103587| title=Royal succession reform is being discussed, Clegg says| date=16 April 2011| publisher=BBC| accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At approximately the same time, it was reported that British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] had written to each of the prime ministers of the other fifteen Commonwealth realms, asking for their support in changing the succession to absolute primogeniture and notifying them he would raise his proposals at [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011|that year's Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM) in [[Perth]], Australia.&lt;ref name=cameron&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15282940| title=David Cameron proposes changes to royal succession| date=12 October 2011| publisher=BBC| accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron reportedly also proposed removing the restriction on successors being or marrying Roman Catholics; however, potential Roman Catholic successors would be required to convert to Anglicanism prior to acceding&lt;!-- OED (to date, online) has &quot;accede&quot; and &quot;succeed&quot;, which is an accurate record of indeed illogical usage --&gt; to the throne. In reaction to the letter and media coverage, Harper stated that, this time, he was &quot;supportive&quot; of what he saw as &quot;reasonable modernizations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1069441--harper-supportive-of-updating-royal-succession-rules| last=Cheadle| first=Bruce| title=Harper 'supportive' of updating royal succession rules| date=14 October 2011| newspaper=Toronto Star| accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At CHOGM on 28 October 2011, the prime ministers of the other Commonwealth realms agreed to support Cameron's proposed changes to the Act.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607| title=Girls equal in British throne succession| publisher=BBC| date=28 October 2011| accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Kennedy| first=Mark| title=Commonwealth leaders agree to change archaic succession rules| url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Commonwealth+leaders+agree+change+archaic+royal+succession+rules/5626087/story.html| date=29 October 2011| newspaper=Montreal Gazette| accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=1&amp;id=4439&amp;featureId=6&amp;pageId=26| last=Office of the Prime Minister of Canada| title=PM welcomes proposal to amend rules governing the royal line of succession| date=28 October 2011| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill put before the Parliament of the United Kingdom would act as a model for the legislation required to be passed in at least some of the other realms, and any changes would only first take effect if the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Duchess of Cambridge]] were to have a daughter before a son.&lt;ref name=Coorey2011-10-29 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607| title=Girls equal in British throne succession |publisher=BBC News| date=28 October 2011| accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Royal succession gender equality approved by Commonwealth |first=Nicholas |last=Watt |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/oct/28/royal-succession-gender-equality-approved |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British group [[Republic (political organisation)|Republic]] asserted that succession reform would not make the monarchy any less discriminatory.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; As it welcomed the gender equality reforms, the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' criticized the lack of a proposal to remove the ban on Catholics sitting on the throne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Editorial Board| title=Royal succession: Queen and country| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2011/oct/28/royal-succession-queen-country| date=28 October 2011| newspaper=The Guardian| accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Alex Salmond]], First Minister of [[Scotland]], who pointed out that &quot;It is deeply disappointing that the reform [of the Act of Settlement of 1701] has stopped short of removing the unjustifiable barrier on a Catholic becoming monarch&quot;.&lt;ref name=Scotsman2011 /&gt; On the subject, Cameron asserted: &quot;Let me be clear, the monarch must be in communion with the Church of England because he or she is the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|head of that Church]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Scotsman2011 /&gt;

'''Aircraft hijacking''' (also known as '''aircraft piracy''', especially within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States, and informally as '''''skyjacking''''') is the unlawful seizure of an [[aircraft]] by an individual or a group. In most cases, the pilot is forced to fly according to the orders of the hijackers. Occasionally, however, the hijackers have flown the aircraft themselves, such as the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001.

Unlike the typical hijackings of land vehicles or ships, skyjacking is not usually committed for robbery or theft. Most aircraft hijackers intend to use the passengers as [[hostage]]s, either for monetary ransom or for some political or administrative concession by authorities. Motives vary from demanding the release of certain [[Incarceration|inmate]]s (notably [[Indian Airlines Flight 814|IC-814]]), highlighting the grievances of a particular community (notably [[Air France Flight 8969|AF 8969]]) to [[political asylum]] (notably [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961|ET 961]]). Hijackers also have used aircraft as a weapon to target particular locations (notably during the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]).

Hijackings for hostages commonly produce an armed standoff during a period of negotiation between hijackers and authorities, followed by some form of settlement. Settlements do not always meet the hijackers' original demands. If the hijackers' demands are deemed too great and the perpetrators show no inclination to surrender, authorities sometimes employ armed [[Counter-terrorism|special forces]] to attempt a rescue of the hostages (notably [[Operation Entebbe]]).

==History==

{{Expand section|date=January 2015}}

The first recorded aircraft hijack took place on February 21, 1931, in [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]]. Byron Richards, flying a [[Ford Tri-Motor]], was approached on the ground by armed revolutionaries. He refused to fly them anywhere and after a 10-day standoff, Richards was informed that the revolution was successful and he could go in return for flying one group member to [[Lima]].
&lt;ref&gt;30 years later Richards was again the victim of a failed hijacking attempt. A father and son boarded his [[Continental Airlines]] [[Boeing 707]] in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and tried to force him at gunpoint to fly the plane to [[Cuba]] hoping for a cash reward from [[Fidel Castro]]. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents and police chased the plane down the runway and shot out its tires, averting the hijacking. See [http://www.airdisaster.com/features/hijack/hijack.shtml http://www.airdisaster.com/features/hijack/hijack.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Fort Worth Star-Telegram daily newspaper (morning edition) 19 September 1970, J. Howard &quot;Doc&quot; DeCelles states that he was actually the victim of the first skyjacking in December 1929. He was flying a postal route for the Mexican company Transportes Aeras Transcontinentales, ferrying mail from San Luis Potosí to Toreon and then on to Guadalajara. &quot;Doc&quot; was approached by Gen. Saturnino Cedillo, governor of the state of San Luis Potosí and one of the last remaining lieutenants of Pancho Villa. Cedillo was accompanied by several other men. He was told through an interpreter he had no choice in the matter. &quot;Doc&quot; stalled long enough to convey the information to his boss, who told him to cooperate. He had no maps, but was guided by the men as he flew above Mexican mountains. He landed on a road as directed, and was held captive for several hours under armed guard. He eventually was released with a &quot;Buenos&quot; from Cedillo and his staff. DeCelles kept his flight log, according to the article, but he did not file a report with authorities. &quot;Doc&quot; went on to work for the FAA in Fort Worth after his flying career.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011|reason=reliable source needed for the whole paragraph}}

The world's first fatal hijacking occurred on 28 October 1939. Earnest P. “Larry” Pletch shot Carl Bivens, 39, a flight instructor who was offering Pletch lessons in a yellow Taylor Cub monoplane with tandem controls in the air after taking off in Brookfield, Missouri. Bivens, instructing from the front seat, was shot in the back of the head twice. “Carl was telling me I had a natural ability and I should follow that line,” Pletch later confessed to prosecutors in Missouri. &quot;I had a revolver in my pocket and without saying a word to him, I took it out of my overalls and I fired a bullet into the back of his head. He never knew what struck him.&quot; The Chicago Daily Tribune called it “One of the most spectacular crimes of the 20th century, and what is believed to be the first airplane kidnap murder on record.” Because it occurred somewhere over three Missouri counties, and involved interstate transport of a stolen airplane, it raised questions in legal circles about where, by whom, and even whether he could be prosecuted. Ernest Pletch pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison, where he died in June 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magbloom.com/PDF/bloom20/Bloom_20_Killer.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Dymshits–Kuznetsov hijacking affair]] on 15 June 1970, a group of Soviet [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|refuseniks]] attempted to hijack a civilian aircraft in order to escape to the [[Western world|West]], were caught and spent many years in Soviet prisons. This case is politically distinct in the sense that the government of Israel {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}, which strongly denounced other cases of aircraft hijacking {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}, endorsed this one and declared its participants to be heroes and martyrs for the [[Zionist]] cause {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}. This was denounced as a [[double standard]] by left-wing critics such as then Knesset Member [[Charlie Biton]].

On September 11, 2001, 19 [[al-Qaeda]] [[Islamic extremist]]s hijacked [[American Airlines Flight 11]], [[United Airlines Flight 175]], [[American Airlines Flight 77]], and [[United Airlines Flight 93]] and crashed them into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center]], the southwestern side of the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon building]], and [[Stonycreek Township, Somerset County, Pennsylvania|Stonycreek Township]] near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]] in a terrorist attack. The 2,996 death toll makes the hijackings the most fatal in history.

===Military aircraft hijacking===

{{main|Rashid Minhas}}

A [[Pakistan Air Force]] [[T-33 Shooting Star|T-33]] trainer was hijacked on August 20, 1971 before the [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971]] in [[Karachi]] when a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] instructor pilot, [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Matiur Rahman (military pilot)|Matiur Rahman]], knocked out the young [[Pilot Officer]] [[Rashid Minhas]] with the intention of defecting to [[India]] with the plane and national secrets. On regaining consciousness in mid-flight, [[Rashid Minhas]] struggled for flight control as well as relaying the news of his hijack to the [[Pakistan Air Force|PAF]] base. In the end of the ensuing struggle he succeeded to crash his aircraft into the ground near [[Thatta]] on seeing no way to prevent the hijack and the defection. He was posthumously awarded Pakistan's highest military award [[Nishan-e-Haider]] (''Sign of the Lion'') for his act of bravery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paf.gov.pk/paf_shaheeds.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/kamra.htm |title=PAF Kamra |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pakistan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/country-by-country/pakistan.htm |title=Pakistan |publisher=Ejection-history.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk/awpreview/TextContent.aspx?pId=176 |title=Pilot Officer Rashid Minhas |publisher=Pakistanarmy.gov.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaa.tv/newsdetail.aspx?ID=35569&amp;CID=1 |title=Nishan-i-Haider laurelled Rashid Minhas’ anniversary today |publisher=Samaa Tv |date= |accessdate=2012-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matiur Rahman was awarded Bangladesh's highest military award, [[Bir Sreshtho]], for his attempt to defect to join the civil war in East Pakistan (modern-day Bangladesh).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pakistan&quot;/&gt;

=== Mystery hijacking ===
{{main|D. B. Cooper}}
D. B. Cooper is perhaps the most famous hijacker of all time, and his case is the only unsolved hijacking in America's aviation history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-NYmag2007-10-21&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

==Dealing with hijackings==
Before the September 11, 2001 attacks, most hijackings involved the plane landing at a certain destination, followed by the hijackers making negotiable demands. [[Aviator|Pilot]]s and [[flight attendant]]s were trained to adopt the &quot;Common Strategy&quot; tactic, which was approved by the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]. It taught crew members to comply with the hijackers' demands, get the plane to land safely and then let the security forces handle the situation. Crew members advised passengers to sit quietly in order to increase their chances of survival. They were also trained not to make any 'heroic' moves that could endanger themselves or other people. The FAA realized that the longer a hijacking persisted, the more likely it would end peacefully with the hijackers reaching their goal.&lt;ref&gt;http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The September 11 attacks presented an unprecedented threat because it involved suicide hijackers who could fly an aircraft and use it to deliberately crash the airplane into buildings for the sole purpose of causing massive casualties, with no warning, demands or negotiations, and no regard for human life. The &quot;Common Strategy&quot; approach was not designed to handle suicide hijackings, and the hijackers were able to exploit a weakness in the civil aviation security system. Since then, the &quot;Common Strategy&quot; policy in the USA and the rest of the world to deal with airplane hijackings has no longer been used.

Since the attacks, the situation for crew members, passengers and hijackers has changed. United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field as flight attendants and passengers&amp;mdash;who had heard about the other three hijacked planes ramming into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon&amp;mdash;fought hijackers who were probably aiming to crash the plane either into the [[White House]] or the [[United States Capitol]]. As on Flight 93, crew members and passengers now have to calculate the risks of passive cooperation, not only for themselves but also for those on the ground. Later examples of active passenger and crew member resistance occurred when passengers and flight attendants of [[2001 Shoe bomb plot|American Airlines Flight 63]] from [[Paris]] to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] on December 22, 2001, teamed up to help prevent [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard Reid]] from igniting explosives hidden in his shoes. Another example is when a few passengers and flight attendants teamed up to subdue [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] who attempted to detonate explosives sewn into his underwear aboard [[Northwest Flight 253]] on December 25, 2009. Flight attendants and pilots now receive extensive anti-hijacking and self-defense training designed to thwart a hijacking or bombing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.secure-skies.org/crewtraining.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informing air traffic control===
To communicate to air traffic control that an aircraft is being hijacked, a pilot under duress should [[Transponder (aviation)#Transponder codes|squawk]] 7500 or vocally, by radio communication, transmit &quot;(Aircraft callsign); Transponder seven five zero zero.&quot; This should be done when possible and safe. An air traffic controller who suspects an aircraft may have been hijacked may ask the pilot to confirm &quot;squawking assigned code.&quot; If the aircraft is ''not'' being hijacked, the pilot should ''not'' squawk 7500 and should inform the controller accordingly. A pilot under [[duress]] may also elect to respond that the aircraft is not being hijacked, but then neglect to change to a different squawk code. In this case, the controller would make no further requests and immediately inform the appropriate authorities. A complete lack of a response would also be taken to indicate a possible hijacking. Of course, a loss of radio communications may also be the cause for a lack of response, in which case a pilot would usually squawk 7'''6'''00 anyway.&lt;ref&gt;Aeronautical Information Manual, paragraph 6-3-4, &quot;Special Emergency (Air Piracy)&quot;, [[Federal Aviation Administration]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9/11, the suicide hijackers did not make any attempt to contact ground control to inform anyone about their hijackings, nor engage in any dialogue or negotiations. However, the hijacker-pilot of Flight 11 and the ringleader of the terrorist cell, [[Mohamed Atta]], mistakenly transmitted announcements to [[Air traffic control|ATC]], meaning to go through the Boeing 767. Also, [[Madeline Amy Sweeney|Amy Sweeney]] and [[Betty Ong]] called the [[American Airlines]] office, telling the workers that Flight 11 was hijacked. 9/11 hijacker-pilot [[Ziad Jarrah]] aboard Flight 93 also made a similar error when he mistakenly transmitted announcements to Cleveland ATC about the hijacking.

===Prevention===
Cockpit doors on most commercial airliners have been strengthened and are now bullet resistant. In the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[France]], [[Air Marshal (civil aviation)|air marshal]]s have also been added to some flights to deter and thwart hijackers. [[Airport security]] plays a major role in preventing hijackers. Screening passengers with [[metal detector]]s and luggage with [[x-ray]] machines helps prevent weapons from being taken on to an aircraft. Along with the FAA, the [[FBI]] also monitors terror suspects. Any person who is seen as a threat to civil aviation is banned from flying.

== Shooting down aircraft ==
According to reports, U.S. fighter pilots have been trained to shoot down hijacked commercial airliners as it is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US pilots train shooting civilian planes|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3161354.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 November 2012|date=10/3/2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other countries, such as [[India]], [[Poland]], and [[Russia]] have enacted similar laws or decrees that allow the shooting down of hijacked planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4172487.stm | work=BBC News | title=Poland to down hijacked aircraft | date=2005-01-13 | accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Polish Constitutional Court however, in September 2008, decided that the regulations were unconstitutional and dismissed them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trybunal.gov.pl/eng/summaries/documents/K_44_07_GB.pdf English translation of the judgement of the court]&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In August 2005, India revealed its new anti-hijacking policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4150640.stm &quot;India adopts tough hijack policy&quot;]. [[BBC News]], August 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy came into force after the [[Cabinet Committee on Security]] (CCS) approved it. The main points of the policy are:
* Any attempt to hijack will be considered an act of aggression against the country and will prompt a response fit for an aggressor.
* Hijackers, if captured, will be sentenced to death.
* Hijackers will be engaged in negotiations only to bring the incident to an end, to comfort passengers and to prevent loss of lives.
* The plane will be shot down if it is deemed to become a missile heading for strategic targets.
* The plane will be escorted by armed fighter aircraft and will be forced to land.
* A grounded plane will not be allowed to take off under any circumstance.

The list of strategic targets is prepared by the Bureau of Civil Aviation in India. The decision to shoot down a plane is taken by CCS. However, due to the shortage of time, whoever – the prime minister, the defense minister or the home minister – can be reached first will take the call. In situations in which an aircraft becomes a threat while taking off – which gives very little reaction time – a decision on shooting it down may be taken by an Indian Air Force officer not below the rank of Assistant Chief of Air Staff (Operations).

===Germany===
In January 2005, a federal law came into force in [[Germany]] – the ''[[Luftsicherheitsgesetz]]'' – that allowed &quot;direct action by armed force&quot; against a hijacked aircraft to prevent a 9/11-type attack. However, in February 2006 the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] struck down these provisions of the law, stating such preventive measures were unconstitutional and would essentially be state-sponsored murder, even if such an act would save many more lives on the ground. The main reasoning behind this decision was that the state would effectively be taking the lives of innocent hostages in order to avoid a terrorist attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/entscheidungen/rs20060215_1bvr035705en.html English translation of the judgement by the court]&lt;/ref&gt; The Court also ruled that the [[Minister of Defense]] is constitutionally not entitled to act in terrorism matters, as this is the duty of the state and federal police forces. ''See the [[:de:Urteil des Bundesverfassungsgerichts zum Luftsicherheitsgesetz 2005|German Wikipedia entry]], or [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4715878.stm]''

The [[President of Germany]], [[Horst Köhler]], himself urged judicial review of the constitutionality of the Luftsicherheitsgesetz after he signed it into law in 2005.

== International law issues ==
{{unrefsect|date=August 2014}}
===Tokyo Convention===
{{original research|section|date=August 2014}}
The Tokyo Convention states in Article 11, defining the so-called unlawful takeover of an aircraft, that the parties signing the agreement are obliged, in case of hijacking or a threat of it, to take all the necessary measures in order to regain or keep control over an aircraft. The detailed analysis of the quoted article shows{{whom?|date=August 2014}} that in order of an unlawful takeover of an aircraft to take place, and at the same time to start the application of the convention, 3 conditions should be met:  
#The hijacking or control takeover of an aircraft must be a result of unlawful use of violence or an attempt to use violence; 
#An aircraft should be “in flight” (that is, according to Article 1, paragraph 3 of the Tokyo Convention, from the moment when power is applied for the purpose of take-off until the moment when the landing run ends); 
#The unlawful act must be committed on board of an aircraft (that is, by a person being on board of an aircraft, e.g. a passenger or crew member. In case of an assault “from the outside”, such an offense would be treated as an act of aviation piracy)  
However, even without the order of the captain, any member of crew or passenger, can take reasonable measures, when he or she has reasonable grounds to believe that such action is necessary to protect the safety of the aircraft, or of people or property therein. The captain may decide to disembark a suspected person on the territory of any country, where the aircraft would land, and that country must agree to that. (Article 8 and 12 of the Convention).

===Hague Convention===
The Convention for the suppression of unlawful seizure of Aircraft known as Hague convention came into force on October 14, 1971
the convention under Article 1 defined the offences which may be covered by the convention.

The '''Acropolis of Athens''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀκρόπολις}};&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]] 2.15.3: &quot;ἡ Ἀκρόπολις ἡ νῦν οὖσα πόλις ῆν&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ell|Ακρόπολη Αθηνών}}) is an ancient [[citadel]] located on a high rocky outcrop above the city of [[Athens]] and contains the remains of several [[Ancient Greek architecture|ancient buildings]] of great architectural and historic significance, the most famous being the [[Parthenon]].  The word  [[acropolis]] comes from the Greek  words {{lang|grc|ἄκρον}} (''akron'', &quot;edge, extremity&quot;) and {{lang|grc|πόλις}} (''polis'', &quot;city&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;acro-. (n.d.). In Greek, Acropolis means &quot;Highest City&quot;.  ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', Fourth Edition.

===Early settlement===
The Acropolis is located on a flat-topped rock that rises {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level in the city of [[Athens]], with a surface area of about {{convert|3|ha}}. It was also known as '''Cecropia''', after the legendary [[snake|serpent]]-man, [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], the first Athenian king. 
While the earliest artifacts date to the Middle [[Neolithic]] era, there have been documented habitations in [[Attica]] from the Early Neolithic (6th millennium BC). There is little doubt that a [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[megaron]] stood upon the hill during the late [[Aegean civilization|Bronze Age]]. Nothing of this [[megaron]] survives except, probably, a single limestone column-base and pieces of several sandstone steps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castleden&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Castleden|first=Rodney|title=Mycenaeans|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Kfi0dAlfJaoC&amp;pg=PA64|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-22782-2|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the palace was constructed, a [[Cyclopean]] massive circuit wall was built, 760 meters long, up to 10 meters high, and ranging from 3.5 to 6 meters thick. This wall would serve as the main defense for the acropolis until the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; The wall consisted of two [[parapet]]s built with large stone blocks and cemented with an earth mortar called ''emplekton'' (Greek: ἔμπλεκτον).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fmplektos ἔμπλεκτος],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; The wall follows typical Mycenaean convention in that  it followed the natural contour of the terrain and its gate was arranged obliquely, with a parapet and tower overhanging the incomers' right-hand side, thus facilitating defense. There were two lesser approaches up the hill on its north side, consisting of steep, narrow flights of steps cut in the rock.  [[Homer]] is assumed to refer to this fortification when he mentions the &quot;strong-built House of [[Erechtheus]]&quot; (''[[Odyssey]]'' 7.81). At some point before the 13th century BC, an earthquake caused a fissure near the northeastern edge of the Acropolis. This fissure extended some 35 meters to a bed of soft marl in which a well was dug.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; An elaborate set of stairs was built and the well served as an invaluable, protected source of drinking water during times of siege for some portion of the Mycenaean period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydriaproject.net/en/cases/athens/acropolis_hill/mycenaean.html &quot;The springs and fountains of the Acropolis hill&quot;], Hydria Project.

===The Dark Ages===
There is no conclusive evidence for the existence of a Mycenean palace on top of the Athenian Acropolis. However, if there was such a palace, it seems to have been supplanted by later building activity. Not much is known as to the architectural appearance of the Acropolis until the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic era]]. In the 7th and the 6th centuries BC, the site was taken over by [[Cylon (ancient Athenian)|Kylon]] during the failed Kylonian revolt,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pomeroy1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pomeroy|first=Sarah B.|title=Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=INUT5sZku1UC&amp;pg=PA163|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-509742-9|pages=163–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and twice by [[Peisistratos]]: all attempts directed at seizing political power by ''[[coup|coups d'état]]''. Peisistratos built an entry gate or [[Propylaea]] and perhaps embarked on the construction of an earlier temple on the site of the Parthenon where fragments of sculptured limestone have been found as well as the foundations of a large unfinished temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/448916/Peisistratus &quot;Peisistratos&quot;], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 2 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it seems that a nine-gate wall, the ''[[Enneapylon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=8242 &quot;Acropolis fortification wall&quot;], Odysseus. Retrieved 2 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; had been built around the biggest water spring, the &quot;[[Water clock|Clepsydra]]&quot;, at the northwestern foot.

===Archaic Acropolis===
A temple to ''[[Athena|Athena Polias]]'' (protectress of the city) was erected around 570–550 BC. This [[Doric order|Doric]] limestone building, from which many relics survive, is referred to as the ''[[Hekatompedon temple|Hekatompedon]]'' (Greek for &quot;hundred–footed&quot;), ''Ur-Parthenon'' (German for &quot;original Parthenon&quot; or &quot;primitive Parthenon&quot;), ''H–Architecture'' or ''Bluebeard'' temple, after the pedimental three-bodied man-serpent sculpture, whose beards were painted dark blue. Whether this temple replaced an older one, or just a sacred precinct or altar, is not known. Probably, the ''Hekatompedon'' was built where the Parthenon now stands.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 529–520 BC yet another temple was built by the [[Peisistratid]]s, the [[Old Temple of Athena]], usually referred to as the ''Arkhaios Neōs'' (ἀρχαῖος νεώς, &quot;ancient temple&quot;). This temple of Athena Polias was built upon the ''Doerpfeld'' foundations,&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; between the [[Erechtheion]] and the still-standing Parthenon. ''Arkhaios Neōs'' was destroyed by the Persian invasion in 480 BC. However, the temple was probably reconstructed since in 454 BC the treasury of the [[Delian League]] was transferred in its [[opisthodomos]]. The temple may have been burnt down in 406/405 BC as [[Xenophon]] mentions that the old temple of Athena was set on fire. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] does not mention it in his 2nd century AD ''Description of Greece''.&lt;ref&gt;{{el icon}} [http://www.eie.gr/archaeologia/gr/02_DELTIA/Old_Temple_of_Athena.aspx], Retrieved 5 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 500 BC the ''Ur-Parthenon'' was dismantled to make place for a newer and grander building, the &quot;[[Older Parthenon]]&quot; (often called ''Pre-Parthenon'', &quot;early Parthenon&quot;). Athenians decided to stop the construction of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Olympieion]] which was related with the tyrant [[Peisistratos]] and his sons and instead used the [[Piraeus]] limestone destined for the Olympieion to build the Older Parthenon. To accommodate it, the south part of the summit was cleared, made level by adding some 8,000 two-ton blocks of limestone, a foundation {{convert|11|m|0|abbr=on}} deep at some points, and the rest filled with earth kept in place by the retaining wall. However, after the victorious [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC, the plan was revised and marble was used instead. The limestone phase of the building is referred to as ''Pre-Parthenon I'', the marble phase as ''Pre-Parthenon II''. In 485 BC, construction stalled to save resources as [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] took the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Manolis Korres, [http://www.eie.gr/archaeologia/En/chapter_more_3.aspx ''Topographic Issues of the Acropolis''], Archaeology of the City of Athens; Retrieved 7 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Older Parthenon was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC. The building was burned and looted, along with the ''Ancient Temple'' and practically everything else on the rock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=7EAE195E7827EA194D2FFC77288CE706?name=Athens%2C+Pre-Parthenon&amp;object=Building &quot;Athens, Pre-Parthenon (Building)&quot;], ''Perseus Digital Library''.

The devastated site was cleared of debris. Statuary, cult objects, religious offerings and unsalvageable architectural members were buried ceremoniously in several deeply dug pits on the hill, serving conveniently as a fill for the artificial plateau created around the classic Parthenon. This [[Perserschutt|&quot;Persian debris&quot;]] is the richest archaeological deposit excavated on the Acropolis and is well known throughout Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Kavvadias, Panagiotis, Kawerau, Georg: ''Die Ausgrabung der Akropolis vom Jahre 1885 bis zum Jahre 1890'', Athens, 1906 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Periclean building program===
[[File:The Parthenon in Athens.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Parthenon]]]]

After winning at [[Battle of the Eurymedon|Eurymedon]] in 468 BC, [[Cimon]] and [[Themistocles]] ordered the reconstruction of the  southern and northern walls of the Acropolis. Most of the major temples, including the [[Parthenon]], were rebuilt under the leadership of [[Pericles]] during the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age of Athens]] (460–430 BC). [[Phidias]], a great Athenian sculptor, and [[Ictinus]] and [[Callicrates]], two famous architects, were responsible for the reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Ictinus_and_Callicrates_wi.html &quot;Ictinus and Callicrates with Phidias&quot;], ''Architecture Week''.

[[File:Propylaea-athens.jpg|thumb|The [[Propylaea]]]]
Construction of the elegant temple of [[Erechtheion]] in Pentelic marble (421–406 BC) was in accordance with a complex plan which took account of the extremely uneven ground and the need to circumvent several shrines in the area. The entrance, facing east, is lined with six Ionic columns. Unusually, the temple has two porches, one on the northwest corner borne by Ionic columns, the other, to the southwest, supported by huge female figures or [[Caryatid]]s. The eastern part of the temple was dedicated to [[Athena Polias]], while the western part, serving the cult of the archaic king [[Erechtheus|Poseidon-Erechtheus]], housed the altars of [[Hephaestus]] and Voutos, brother of Erechtheus. Little is known about the original plan of the interior which was destroyed by fire in the first century BC and has been rebuilt several times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/erechtheion.html Thomas Sakoulas, &quot;Erechtheion&quot;], Ancient-Greece.org.

==The Acropolis Restoration Project==
[[File:Acropolis under construction 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Looking east toward the Acropolis under construction in summer 2014.]]

The Project began in 1975 and is now nearing completion.  The aim of the restoration was to reverse the decay of centuries of attrition, pollution, destruction by acts of war, and misguided past restorations.  The project included collection and identification of all stone fragments, even small ones, from the Acropolis and its slopes and the attempt was made to restore as much as possible using reassembled original material ([[Anastylosis]]) - with new marble from [[Mount Penteli]] used sparingly.  All restoration was made using [[titanium]] dowels and is designed to be completely reversible, in case future experts decide to change things.  A combination of cutting-edge modern technology and extensive research and reinvention of ancient techniques were used.&lt;ref name=umich&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/modgreek/Home/Window%20to%20Greek%20Culture/Lectures%20at%20U-M/LaUM_Mallouchou_restorationacropolis.pdf Fani Mallouchou-Tufano, &quot;The Restoration of the Athenian Acropolis&quot;], University of Michigan. Retrieved 9 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parthenon colonnades, largely destroyed by Venetian bombardment in the 17th century, were restored, with many wrongly assembled columns now properly placed.  The roof and floor of the Propylaea were partly restored, with sections of the roof made of new marble and decorated with blue and gold inserts, as in the original.&lt;ref name=umich/&gt; Restoration of the Temple of Athena Nike was completed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ysma.gr/static/files/Newsletter11_ENG.pdf &quot;2010 – 2011, The progress of restoration on the Acropolis&quot;], ''The Acropolis Restoration News'', July 2011. Retrieved 9 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 2,675 tons of architectural members were restored, with 686 stones reassembled from fragments of the originals, 905 patched with new marble, and 186 parts made entirely of new marble.  A total of 530 cubic meters of new Pentelic marble were used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/hellenic/ &quot;Acropolis Restoration Project-Lecture by Maria Ioannidou, Director, Acropolis Restoration Service&quot;], Columbia University. Retrieved 9 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==

Every four years, the Athenians held a festival called the [[Panathenaea]] that rivaled the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] in popularity. During the festival, a procession (believed to be depicted on the Parthenon frieze) traveled through the city via the Panathenaic Way and culminated on the Acropolis.  There, a new robe of woven wool (''[[peplos]]'') was placed on either the statue of Athena Polias in the Erechtheum (during a regular Panathenaea) or on the statue of Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon (during the Great Panathenaea, held every four years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/athnlife/rligious.htm |title=Panathenaic Festical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the later tradition of [[Western Civilization]] and [[classicism|classical revival]] the Acropolis, from at least the mid-18th century on, has often been invoked as a key symbol of the Greek legacy and of the glories of [[Classical Greece]].

Columbia University, 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Germans|German]] philosopher and founder of the [[Illuminati|Order of the Illuminati]], a secret society.

==Early life==
Adam Weishaupt was born on 6 February 1748 in [[Ingolstadt]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB Vol. 41&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&amp;pg=PR6#PPA22,M1 22].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Electorate of Bavaria]]. Weishaupt's father [[Johann Georg Weishaupt]] (1717–1753) died&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; when Adam was five years old. After his father's death he came under the tutelage of his [[Godparent|godfather]] [[Johann Adam von Ickstatt|Johann Adam Freiherr von Ickstatt]]&lt;ref&gt;''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'' [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/bsb00008371/image_742 Vol. 13, pp. 740–741].&lt;/ref&gt; who, like his father, was a professor of law at the [[University of Ingolstadt]].&lt;ref&gt;Freninger, Franz Xaver, ed. ''Das Matrikelbuch der Universitaet Ingolstadt-Landshut-München''. München: A. Eichleiter, 1872. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Ickstatt was a proponent of the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]],&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, Peter Claus. ''Bayerns Weg in die Gegenwart''. Regensburg: Pustet, 1989. 262. Also, Bauerreiss, Romuald. ''Kirchengeschichte Bayerns''. Vol. 7. St. Ottilien: EOS Verlag, 1970. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; and he influenced the young Weishaupt with his [[rationalism]]. Weishaupt began his formal education at age seven&lt;ref name=&quot;ref name=&quot;ADB Vol. 41&quot;/&gt; at a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school. He later enrolled at the University of Ingolstadt and graduated in 1768&lt;ref&gt;Freninger 47.&lt;/ref&gt; at age 20 with a [[Juris Doctor|doctorate of law]].&lt;ref&gt;Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&amp;pg=PR6#PPA25,M1 25–28].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1772&lt;ref&gt;Freninger 32.&lt;/ref&gt; he became a professor of law. The following year he married Afra Sausenhofer&lt;ref&gt;Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&amp;pg=PR6#PPA31,M1 31].&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Eichstätt]].

After [[Pope Clement XIV]]’s [[suppression of the Society of Jesus]] in 1773, Weishaupt became a professor of [[canon law]],&lt;ref&gt;Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&amp;pg=PR6#PPA33,M1 33]. Also, ''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'' [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/bsb00008399/image_542 Vol. 41, p. 540].&lt;/ref&gt; a position that was held exclusively by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] until that time. In 1775 Weishaupt was introduced&lt;ref&gt;Engel [http://books.google.com/books?id=v72fDHzuMf0C&amp;pg=PR6#PPA61,M1 61–62].&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Empiricism|empirical]] philosophy of [[Johann Georg Heinrich Feder]]&lt;ref&gt;''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie'' [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/bsb00008364/image_597 Vol. 6, pp. 595–597].&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]]. Both Feder and Weishaupt would later become opponents of [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] [[idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Beiser, Frederick C. ''The Fate of Reason''. Harvard University Press, 1987. [http://books.google.com/books?id=5ihJn9EKCl4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA186,M1 186–88].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder of the Illuminati==
{{quote|At a time, however, when there was no end of making game of and abusing secret societies, I planned to make use of this human foible for a real and worthy goal, for the benefit of people.

On May day 1776 Johann Adam Weishaupt founded the &quot;Illuminati&quot; in the Electorate of Bavaria. He adopted the name of &quot;Brother [[Spartacus]]&quot; within the order. Even Encyclopedia references vary on the goal of the order, such as New Advent saying the Order was not [[egalitarian]] or democratic internally, and sought to promote the doctrines of equality and freedom throughout society;&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia: [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07661b.htm Illuminati],&lt;/ref&gt; while others like Collier's have said the aim was to combat religion and foster rationalism in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Couch |first=William |date=1956 |title=Collier's Encyclopedia, Volume 10 |url= |location= |publisher=Crowell-Collier Publishing Company |page=370 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual character of the society was an elaborate network of spies and counter-spies. Each isolated cell of initiates reported to a superior, whom they did not know: a party structure that was effectively adopted by some later groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

Weishaupt was initiated into the [[Masonic Lodge]] &quot;Theodor zum guten Rath&quot;, at Munich in 1777. His project of &quot;illumination, enlightening the understanding by the sun of reason, which will dispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice&quot; was an unwelcome reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; /&gt; He used Freemasonry to recruit for his own quasi-masonic society, with the goal of &quot;perfecting human nature&quot; through re-education to achieve a communal state with nature, freed of government and organized religion. Presenting their own system as pure masonry, Weishaupt and [[Adolph Freiherr Knigge]], who organised his ritual structure, greatly expanded the secret organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; /&gt;

Contrary to Immanuel Kant's famous dictum that Enlightenment (and Weishaupt's Order was in some respects an expression of the Enlightenment Movement) was the passage by man out of his 'self-imposed immaturity' through daring to 'make use of his own reason, without the guidance of another,' Weishaupt's Order of Illuminati prescribed in great detail everything which the members had obediently to read and think, so that Dr. Wolfgang Riedel has commented that this approach to illumination or enlightenment constituted a degradation and twisting of the Kantian principle of Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Wolfgang Riedel, 'Aufklaerung und Macht', in ''Die Weimarer Klassik und ihre Geheimbuende'', ed. by W. Mueller-Seidel and W. Riedel, Koenigshausen und Neumann, 2002, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Riedel writes:
'The independence of thought and judgement required by Kant ... was specifically prevented by the Order of the Illuminati's rules and regulations. Enlightenment takes place here, if it takes place at all, precisely ''under''  the direction of another, namely under that of the &quot;Superiors&quot; [of the Order].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Wolfgang Riedel, ''Die Weimarer Klassik und ihre Geheimbuende'',2002, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Weishaupt's radical rationalism and vocabulary was not likely to succeed. Writings that were intercepted in 1784 were interpreted as seditious, and the Society was banned by the government of [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Karl Theodor]], Elector of Bavaria, in 1784.

He received the assistance of [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|Duke Ernest II]] of [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]] (1745–1804), and lived in [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] writing a series of works on illuminism, including ''A Complete History of the Persecutions of the Illuminati in Bavaria'' (1785), ''A Picture of Illuminism'' (1786), ''An Apology for the Illuminati'' (1786), and ''An Improved System of Illuminism'' (1787).

After Weishaupt's Order of Illuminati was banned and its members dispersed, it left behind no enduring traces of an influence, not even on its own erstwhile members, who went on in the future to develop in quite different directions.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Eberhard Weis in ''Die Weimarer Klassik und ihre Geheimbünde'', edited by Professor Walter Müller-Seidel and Professor Wolfgang Riedel, Königshausen und Neumann, 2003, pp. 100-101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment of character and intentions==
[[File:Illuminaten397.jpg|thumb|Death mask of Adam Weishaupt]]
Weishaupt's character and intentions have been variously assessed: from those such as the Abbé Barruel and John Robison who regarded him as a 'human devil' and saw his mission as one of malevolent destructiveness, to those who view him as a humane and benign, albeit wilful, social reformer. Writing on this topic, Dr. Tony Page comments:

&quot;Weishaupt’s plan was to educate Illuminati followers in the highest levels of humanity and morality (basing his teachings on the supremacy of Reason, allied with the spirit of the Golden Rule of not doing to others what one would not wish done to oneself), so that if Illuminati alumni subsequently attained positions of significance and power (such as in the fields of education and politics), they could exert a benevolent and uplifting influence upon society at large. His project was utopian and naively optimistic, and he himself was certainly not without flaws of character – but neither he nor his plan was evil or violent in and of themselves. It is one of the deplorable and tragic ironies of history that a man who tried to inculcate virtue, philanthropy, social justice and morality has become one of the great hate-figures of 21st-century ‘conspiracy’ thinking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Tony Page (translator and editor), ''Supplement to the Justification of My Intentions by Adam Weishaupt'', Justice Publications, Bangkok, Amazon Kindle, 2014, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adam Weishaupt in pop culture==

Adam Weishaupt is referred to repeatedly in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'', written by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]], as the founder of the [[Illuminati]] and as an imposter who killed [[George Washington]] and took his place as the first president of the [[United States]]. Washington's portrait on the [[U.S. one-dollar bill]] is said to actually be Weishaupt's.

Another version of Adam Weishaupt appears in the extensive comic book novel ''[[Cerebus the Aardvark]]'' by [[Dave Sim]], as a combination of Weishaupt and George Washington. He appears primarily in the ''Cerebus'' and ''[[Church &amp; State I]]'' volumes. His motives are [[republic]]an confederalizing of city-states in Estarcion (a pseudo-Europe) and the accumulation of capital unencumbered by government or church.

Weishaupt's name is one of many references made to the [[Illuminati]] and other conspiracies in the video game ''[[Deus Ex]]'' (2000). The protagonist uncovers a virus engineered by the VersaLife Corporation with its molecular structure in multiples of [[23 enigma|17 and 23]]. An ally of the protagonist notes &quot;1723. The birth of Adam Weishaupt&quot; even though this reference is actually incorrect as Weishaupt was born in 1748.&lt;ref&gt;GameFAQs, [http://db.gamefaqs.com/computer/doswin/file/deus_ex_script.txt Deus Ex (PC) game script].&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Weishaupt is also mentioned (&quot;[[George W. Bush|Bush]] got a [[ouija]] to talk to Adam Weishaupt&quot;) by the New York rapper [[Cage Kennylz|Cage]] in [[El-P]]'s &quot;Accidents Don't Happen&quot;, the ninth track on his album ''[[Fantastic Damage]]'' (2002).

Adam Weishaupt is briefly mentioned in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Prague Cemetery]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Umberto Eco, ''The Prague Cemetery'' (Boston and New York 2011), 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Acorn Electron''' is a budget version of the [[BBC Micro]] educational/[[home computer]] made by [[Acorn Computers Ltd]]. It has 32 [[kilobyte]]s of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]], and its [[Read-only memory|ROM]] includes [[BBC BASIC]] v2 along with its [[Acorn MOS|operating system]].

The Electron was able to save and load programs onto [[compact audio cassette|audio cassette]] via a supplied converter cable that connected it to any standard [[tape recorder]] that had the correct sockets. It was capable of basic graphics, and could display onto either a television set, a colour ([[RGB]]) monitor or a &quot;[[Green-screen display|green screen]]&quot; monitor.

At its peak, the Electron was the third best selling micro in the [[United Kingdom]], {{Citation needed|reason=I'm sure it's true but it needs backing up with proof - when was the peak? Which computers outsold it and which did out outsell?|date=September 2013}} and total lifetime game sales for the Electron exceeded those of the BBC Micro.{{Citation needed|reason=again, reliable source needed to back this up|date=September 2013}}

==History==
[[File:Hard reset Acorn Electron.gif|thumb|BASIC prompt after switch-on or hard reset (soft reset was similar but did not contain the Acorn trademark).]]

After [[Acorn Computer]] released the [[BBC Micro]], executives believed that the company needed a less-expensive computer for the mass market. In June 1982, cofounder [[Hermann Hauser]] was asked about the recently announced £175 [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]]'s potential to hurt sales of the BBC Micro. Hauser responded that in the third quarter of that year Acorn would release a new £120-150 computer which &quot;will probably be called the Electron&quot;, with graphics superior to the Spectrum's and compatibility with BBC Micro software. Acorn's [[Chris Curry]] stated that &quot;the Electron is designed to compete with the Spectrum. The idea is to get the starting price very low, but not preclude expansion in the long term.&quot; The company reduced the number of chips in the Electron by 90% from the BBC Micro's about 100, with most functionality on a single [[Uncommitted Logic Array]] (ULA). Problems with the ULA delayed the Electron, however, and Acorn repeatedly missed deadlines to ship the computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith20130823&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/08/23/acorn_electron_history_at_30/ | title=Acorn’s would-be ZX Spectrum killer, the Electron, is 30 | publisher=The Register | work=2013-08-23 | accessdate=12 January 2015 | author=Smith, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acorn formally announced the Electron at the [[Acorn User|''Acorn User'' Exhibition]] in August 1983, one year after Hauser mentioned the computer, by which time its price had risen to £175 while the Spectrum cost £130. The company expected to ship the Electron before Christmas, and sell 100,000 by February 1984. Reviews were generally favorable, noting its excellent graphics compared to the [[Commodore 64]]. While its speed was acceptable compared to the Commodore and competing computers the Electron was, however, much slower than the BBC Micro; ''[[Popular Computing Weekly]]'' reported, for example, that BBC Micro games ran &quot;at less than half the speed, with very significant effects on their appeal&quot;. {{r|smith20130823}}

The ULA continued to cause problems, delaying large-scale manufacturing. By October 1983 Acorn had received orders for more than 150,000 units, and expected to produce 25,000 a month before Christmas; the existing backlog would take more than six months to fulfill. Demand for the Electron was high but only two of [[WH Smith]]'s London branches had inventory. As the company increased production during 1984, however, the British home-computer market greatly weakened; one Acorn executive later said, &quot;after Christmas [1983] they were just delivering and the company ended up with £43 million of unsaleable stock&quot;. Acorn's Christmas 1984 sales were greatly below expectations and in January 1985 the company reduced the Electron's price to £129. In conjunction with an unsuccessful expansion into the United States, by February Acorn's [[market capitalization]] declined 85% from the previous year. [[Olivetti]] acquired the company later that year and [[Dixons Retail]] acquired the remaining Electron inventory for less than manufacturing cost, ending Acorn's home-computer business.{{r|smith20130823}}

With hindsight, the machine lacked the RAM (a typical program would need to fit in only around 20&amp;nbsp;kB once display memory is subtracted) and processing power to take on the prevailing Spectrum and Commodore 64. Despite this, several features that would later be associated with [[BBC Master]] and [[Acorn Archimedes|Archimedes]] were first features of Electron expansion units, including ROM cartridge slots and the [[Advanced Disc Filing System]], a hierarchical improvement to the BBC's original [[Disc Filing System]].

While it may not have been as popular as the Spectrum, Commodore 64 or [[Amstrad CPC]], it did sell in sufficient numbers to ensure that new software was being produced right up until the early 1990s. This meant the Electron had a lifespan not much shorter than those more popular micros and much longer than competitors such as the [[Oric-1]] and [[Dragon 32]].

==Popular upgrades==

===Acorn Plus 1===
[[File:Acorn Electron and Plus 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An Acorn Electron with Plus 1 expansion unit attached]]
The Acorn Plus 1 added two ROM cartridge slots, an analogue interface (supporting two channels) and a Centronics parallel port. The analogue interface was normally used for joysticks, the parallel for a printer. The ROM slots could be booted from via the &quot;Shift+BREAK&quot; key-combination. (The slot at the front of the interface took priority if both were populated).

Access to ROM memory occurred at 2&amp;nbsp;MHz regardless of graphics mode so theoretically programs released on ROM could run at least twice as fast as those released on tape or disc. Despite this all of the games released on ROM were packaged as &quot;serial ROMS&quot;, from which the micro would load programs into main memory in exactly the same way as if it were loading from tape. This meant that programs did not need to be modified for their new memory location but gave no execution speed benefits.

The Cartridge-port ROM-slots provided additional control lines, (compared to the lines available via the Edge-connector on the rear of the Electron), such as ROMSTBY, SNDIN, ROMQA, and some additional Voltage sources (+16V) etc. The total number of lines exposed via the Cartridge port almost matched those from the 1&amp;nbsp;MHz bus of the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;Electron Advanced User Guide -  Appendix E&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional peripheral cartridge-holders by companies such as P.R.E.S. (via their [http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/hardware/cats/acp_pres.html ARA/ARA2/ASR] products) allowed [[Sideways address space|'Sideways ROM']] capability, that allowed the standard Acorn ROM space to be programmatically mapped out for alternative EPROMs, either physically via ZIF Sockets, or 'virtually' via ROM-images loaded into (battery-backed) RAM in the same ROM memory space. This enabled the Electron to achieve the same functionality as that provided by the Expansion-ROM slots under the keyboard and on the bottom-left of the BBC Micro B keyboard.

The addition of the Plus 1 added a number of new *FX and OSBYTE calls that allowed the OS to read the values from the analogue and parallel interfaces.

====Compatibility====
The Plus 1 needed memory page &amp;D for its workspace, and some games used this space. To disable the Plus 1, after pressing BREAK, the following commands could be issued:

 *FX163,128,1&lt;br&gt;
 ?&amp;212=&amp;D6&lt;br&gt;
 ?&amp;213=&amp;F1&lt;br&gt;
 ?&amp;2AC=0

===Acorn Plus 2===
Per a News article on Page #9 of the October 1984 issue of Acorn User, the Acorn 'Plus 2' interface was due to provide [[Econet]] capability. This interface did not make it to market.

===Acorn Plus 3===
[[File:Acorn ALA13 Electron Plus 3 (front).jpg|thumb|Acorn Plus 3, showing the connector and disc drive]]
The Acorn Plus 3 was a hardware module that connected independently of the Plus 1 and provided a double-density 3½&quot; disc drive connected through a [[WD1770]] drive controller and an [[Advanced Disc Filing System|ADFS]] ROM. There were two versions of the Plus 3 produced: A Single-sided and a Double-sided drive version. Because the WD1770 is capable of single density mode and uses the same IBM360 derived floppy disc format as the Intel 8271 found in the BBC Micro, it was also possible to run a [[Disc Filing System|DFS]] filing system with an alternate ROM, such as the P.R.E.S AP4 interface.

The Plus 3 reset PAGE to &amp;1D00, reducing the amount of free RAM available to user. The ADFS system could be temporarily disabled (and PAGE reset to &amp;E00) via the &lt;tt&gt;*NOADFS&lt;/tt&gt; command. Alternative WD1770-based DFS and ADFS interfaces such as the P.R.E.S AP4 and 'ADFS E00' products left PAGE at &amp;E00, and did not require the presence of the ZYSYSHELP file (see below)

Disks had to be manually mounted and dismounted using the &lt;tt&gt;*MOUNT / *DISMOUNT&lt;/tt&gt; commands, or using the &lt;tt&gt;CTRL-A+BREAK&lt;/tt&gt; key combination. Disks could also be booted from via the standard &quot;Shift+BREAK&quot; key-combination, if the !BOOT file was present on the disk. This behaviour was the same as on the BBC Micro.

The Plus 3 included an uprated square black power supply unit with mains cord, manufactured by STC, designed and manufactured in England to BS 415 and BS 5850, that was designed to power the Plus 3, in addition to the Electron and the Plus 1 interface as well. This replaced the original cream-coloured &quot;wall wart&quot; style power supply, designed to BS 415 and manufactured in Hong Kong.

*'''Original'''; Part no: unknown; input 220/240V AC/50&amp;nbsp;Hz; output 19V AC/0.737A/14W:  '''Usage''':   Electron, Electron+Plus1
*'''Uprated''' Part no: 865-010;   input 240V AC/50&amp;nbsp;Hz 50W; output 21V AC/1.75A/36.75W: '''Usage''': Electron+Plus3, Electron+Plus3+Plus1

The original Electron Edge-connector was repeated on the back of the Plus3, in addition to a secondary smaller edge-connector, that enabled additional drives to be connected ([[Shugart bus|Shugart]]-compatible connection). These required their own power-supply. The secondary edge-connector could not power external drives.

Repair note: If the internal power-supply connector, used to power the existing internal 3.5&quot; drive is damaged, and requires replacement, then the original AMP 800-930 4-pin connector, which was already in short supply during the original production run, may be replaced with a Molex 5264 50-37-5043 &quot;Mini-SPOX&quot; connector as an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stardot.org.uk/forums/download/file.php?id=4417&amp;sid=0a0f02b8369739630c42f2d91c6594be |title=Acorn Electron Disc Drive Connector - Internal Memo |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If using the Plus3 in screen modes 0-3, the pseudo-variable &lt;tt&gt;TIME&lt;/tt&gt; would be thrown off, as the interrupts were disabled during disk access in these modes.

Per a News article on page 9 of the October 1984 issue of Acorn User, the Plus 3 was originally designed to have used the Intel 8272 disk controller, (and not 8271, which were in short supply at the time).

====ADFS quirks====
The ADFS file format used the bytes &lt;tt&gt;[[Advanced Disc Filing System|Hugo]]&lt;/tt&gt; to delimit the directory names on the disc, named after ADFS inventor Hugo Tyson. Another quirk was the presence of the file  &lt;tt&gt;ZYSYSHELP&lt;/tt&gt; which was required by the system, and created during formatting. This was a kludge. Acorn's v1.0 ADFS implementation on the Electron was unreliable when writing to the first few tracks of a disc, so this was a &quot;fix&quot; and simply involved writing a file full of garbage to the suspect part. The ADFS would then skip it. Disc corruption could also occur if attempting to use the &lt;tt&gt;*COMPACT&lt;/tt&gt; command without disabling the blinking cursor with the following command:
&lt;pre&gt;VDU23,1,0;0;0;0; &lt;/pre&gt; This was due to the fact that the &lt;tt&gt;*COMPACT&lt;/tt&gt; command used screen memory as working space during the operation, and the blinking cursor corrupted that memory space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portices.fr/formation/Res/Info/Dimet/Ordinateurs/AcornBBC/www.stairwaytohell.com/Ressources/r-EU-ACP-E00ADFS.html |title=Stairwaytohell.Com - Hardware |publisher=Portices.fr |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disc formatting was done via the &lt;tt&gt;*EFORM&lt;/tt&gt; command, vs the more familiar &lt;tt&gt;*FORM40/*FORM80&lt;/tt&gt; DFS commands. Note additionally that the &lt;tt&gt;*EFORM&lt;/tt&gt; command differs from the equivalent &lt;tt&gt;*AFORM&lt;/tt&gt; command for the 1770 ADFS on the BBC Microcomputer. This is possibly as a result of needing to create the ZYSYSHELP file on the Electron. The *EFORM command was only supplied on the Welcome disc that was shipped with the Plus3, and was not included in the ROM.

===First Byte Joystick Interface===
As a games machine the Electron shared the same failing as the Sinclair Spectrum in not having a joystick port. This was quickly remedied by First Byte Computers who developed an interface and software which allowed a &quot;switched&quot; joystick to be used with the majority of software titles. This interface became very popular and was sold by W.H. Smiths, Boots, Comet and hundreds of independent computer dealers.

===P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 3===
[[File:Advanced Plus 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 3 with a 3½&quot; drive]]
The Advanced Plus 3 was very similar to the Acorn Plus 3 but packaged as an ADFS ROM cartridge for the Plus 1 with a disc drive connector at the head. This made it possible to connect a 5¼&quot; floppy disc drive as used by BBC Micro owners or a more common 3½&quot; drive.

===P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 5===
[http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/hardware/cats/acp_pres.html AP5] Provided User Port (all lines), 1&amp;nbsp;MHz bus and 'Tube' bus capability, enabling second processor usage.
For the PRES5, and other similar interfaces, the User Port is usually implemented via a 6522 VIA chip.

===Slogger/Elektuur Turbo Board===
The Slogger and Elektuur Turbo Boards were born out of a hack initially devised at Acorn. By moving the lowest 8&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM outside of reach of the ULA, the CPU could always access it at 2&amp;nbsp;MHz. The tradeoff was that the screen could not be located in that 8&amp;nbsp;kB. In practice the operating system ROMs always put the screen into the top 24&amp;nbsp;kB and as a result this probably only broke compatibility with around 2% of software.

The Slogger Turbo Board was a professionally fitted upgrade whereas the Elektuur modification was described in an article in Dutch Electronics magazine Elektuur and intended for users to perform at home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.8bs.com/see/kupers_electron_6.jpg ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speeding up the low portion of memory is particularly useful on 6502 derived machines because that processor has a faster addressing mode for the first 256 bytes and so it is common for software to put any variables involved in time critical sections of program into that region.

If Acorn had thought to include this small modification in the original Electron design it is likely the machine would have had a much greater impact as it would have nearly doubled the amount of motion possible in games and saved modes 0–3 (including the only 16 colour mode) from being nearly useless due to contended memory timings.

===Slogger Master RAM Board===
A development of the Turbo Board, the Master RAM Board duplicated the Turbo Board functionality and added a further option of running the micro with 32&amp;nbsp;kB of shadow RAM in addition to the ordinary 32&amp;nbsp;kB —  giving 64&amp;nbsp;kB total. Some clever program counter catches meant that the ordinary system ROMs and any software using the OS calls could function without significant modification, making substantially more memory available for BASIC, View, Viewsheet and almost every other business application. By providing extra storage this modification also allowed some games and applications intended for the BBC Micro to function on the Electron despite the lack of a native Mode 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobbyist page describing BBC Micro software compatibility using 64 bK expansion cards&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Applications could not directly address video memory in this mode without modification, so it was incompatible with most games, although there is no inherent reason why a game could not be written to function in shadow mode.

During its decline, Master RAM Boards were added to every Electron in an attempt to increase sales.

===Jafa Systems Mode 7 Display Unit===
Of the capabilities present in the BBC Micro but absent from the Electron, the [[teletext]]-style ''mode 7'' was particularly conspicuous because of the very low memory usage in that mode (just less than 1&amp;nbsp;kB) and the high number of BBC programs that used it. [http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/hardware/cats/jafa.html Jafa Systems] provided a number of solutions to redress this deficiency. (Note - the Jafa interface did not provide Teletext interface itself, but it did work in conjunction with specific CEEFAX/Teletext/Prestel adaptors from other manufacturers such as Morley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/aab/revs/jafa/r-m7du.html |title=A&amp;B Computing review |publisher=Acornelectron.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/hardware/cats/morley.html |title=Acorn Electron World - Hardware, Information &amp; Link Archives |publisher=Acornelectron.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The most basic solution was a pure software system supplied on a ROM cartridge that drew a low resolution approximation of the mode 7 display in a graphics mode. Although cheap and effective in enabling use of some software that only used official ROM entry points for text output, this solution proved very slow because the Electron had to be placed into an 80-byte-pitch display to be able to get anywhere near to reproducing mode 7 and the CPU spent a lot of time drawing approximations of mode 7 characters and graphics that in a hardware solution would be achieved without any CPU processing. It also used up 20&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM for the graphics display rather than the 1&amp;nbsp;kB of a hardware mode 7.

Two solutions with additional hardware were provided. The first used the same graphics processor as the BBC Micro in mode 7 — the [[SAA5050]] — but used software to ensure that it was fed with the correct graphics data. A software ROM would put the machine into an ordinary 40-byte-pitch display. While the ULA would read the display from memory in the usual fashion, the SAA5050 would listen to the data it was reading and produce a mode 7 interpretation of the same information. When necessary the hardware would switch between the graphics output being produced by the micro and that being produced by the add-on.

The disadvantage to this system is that while the SAA5050 would expect to be repeatedly fed the same 40 bytes of data for every display scanline of each character row, the ULA would read a different set of 40 bytes for every display scanline in order to produce a full graphics display. A software ROM worked around this by duplicating the data intended for a mode 7 display in memory. Although this produced a mode 7 that barely impacted upon CPU performance and gave the same visual quality as the BBC Micro, it remained compatible only with software that used the ROM routines for outputting text and graphics and still used 10&amp;nbsp;kB of memory for the display.

A second version of the hardware add-on corrected these problems. By adding a [[CRTC6845]] to the package, a full hardware solution was created that did not reduce CPU performance and only used 1&amp;nbsp;kB of memory for the display. A software ROM was still supplied, but this did no more than expand the hardware ROM so that it knew mode 7 now existed and was able to switch into it.

===Electron Second Processor===
During the latter years, PMS produced a [http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/mags/aab/revs/pms/r-e2p.html 2nd Processor] specifically for the Electron. This provided an alternative to buying the combination of the P.R.E.S. Advanced Plus 5 and Acorn 6502 2nd Processor.

==Merlin M2105==
An unusual variant of the Electron was sold by [[British Telecom]] Business Systems as the BT Merlin M2105 Communications Terminal. This consisted of a de-badged Electron plus a large expansion unit containing 32&amp;nbsp;kB of RAM, 48&amp;nbsp;kB of ROM, a [[Centronics printer port]] and a [[modem]]. The ROM firmware provided [[dial-up]] communications facilities. These were used by the [[Interflora]] florists network in the UK for over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acornelectron.co.uk/hardware/cats/bt.html |title=Merlin M2105 information |publisher=Acornelectron.co.uk |date= |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acorn.chriswhy.co.uk/Computers/BT_MerlinM2105.html |title=Chris's Acorns: BT Merlin M2105 |publisher=Acorn.chriswhy.co.uk |date=16 January 2008 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical information==
The hardware of the BBC Micro was emulated by a single customized ULA chip designed by Acorn in conjunction with [[Ferranti]]. It had feature limitations such as the inability to output more than one channel of sound or provide [[teletext]] mode.{{r|smith20130823}} By contrast, the BBC Micro was capable of three-way polyphony (plus one noise channel).

The edge-connector on the rear of the Electron exposed almost all the Bus lines, but not all. (The BBC Micro, courtesy of all its ports, exposed all lines.)

For Issue 1-4 motherboards, the ULA had an issue similar to those experienced by other socketed CPU's. Over time, the thermal heating and cooling could cause the ULA to rise slightly out of its socket just enough to cause the machine to start exhibiting 'hanging' or other startup-failure issues, such as a continuous 'startup beep'. This was despite a metal cover, and locking-bar mechanism designed to prevent this from occurring. Pushing down on the metal cover to reseat the ULA was normally sufficient to rectify these issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/physical-object/acorn/102688877.lg.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7zQebyfYlPE/T0dYrkTIIpI/AAAAAAAAAVY/injg8GeCoco/s1600/DSCF3052.JPG&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kyRwGNknHnU/T0dZHG8ThnI/AAAAAAAAAVo/JMFmxQLJstY/s1600/DSCF3055.JPG&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bygonebytes.co.uk/images/electron_issue4.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; Issue 5 and 6 boards utilized a different epoxy resin covering directly over the ULA, which resolved this issue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bygonebytes.co.uk/images/electron_issue6.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

The keyboard included a form of single-key keyword input, similar to that used on the Sinclair Spectrum, via the 'func' key. However, unlike the Spectrum, the single-keypress keyword-entry was optional, and keywords could be entered manually if preferred.

The ULA controlled memory access and was able to provide 32K × 8 bits of addressable RAM using 4 × 64K × 1-bit [[random-access memory|RAM]] chips (4164). Due to needing two accesses to each chip instead of one, and the complications of the video hardware also needing access, reading or writing RAM was much slower than on the BBC Micro. This meant that although ROM applications ran at the same speed, there was a substantial speed decrease on applications running from RAM.

===Quirks===
[[File:ExileElectron.png|thumb|left|''[[Exile (1988 video game)|Exile]]'' is an example of a game where the developers left non-graphical data visible in the display buffer to gain additional memory space.]]
Like the [[BBC Micro]], the Electron was constrained by limited memory resources. Of the 32&amp;nbsp;kB RAM, 3½ kB was allocated to the OS at startup and at least 10&amp;nbsp;kB was taken up by the display buffer in contiguous display modes.

Due to the timing of interrupts it was possible to disable either the top 100 or bottom 156 lines of the display with palette changes. Many games took advantage of this, gaining storage by leaving non-graphical data in the disabled area.

Other games would load non-graphical data into the display, leaving it visible as regions of apparently randomly coloured pixels.

Although [[page flipping]] was a hardware possibility, the limited memory forced most applications to do all their drawing directly to the visible screen, often resulting in graphical [[Flicker (screen)|flicker]] or visible redraw. A notable exception is [[Players (publisher)|Players]]' ''[[Joe Blade]]'' series.

===Tricks===

====FireTrack: smooth vertical scrolling====
Although programs can alter the position of the screen in memory, the non-linear format of the display means that vertical scrolling can only be done in blocks of 8 pixels without further work.

''[[Firetrack|FireTrack]]'' exploits a division in the way the Electron handles its display — of the seven available graphics modes, two are configured so that the final two of every ten scanlines are blank and are not based on the contents of RAM. If 16 scanlines of continuous graphical data are written to a character-block-aligned portion of the screen then they will appear as a continuous block in most modes but in the two non-continuous modes they will be displayed as two blocks of eight scanlines, separated in the middle by two blank scanlines.

In order to keep track of its position within the display, the Electron maintains an internal display address counter. The same counter is used in both the continuous and non-continuous graphics modes and switching modes mid-frame does not cause any adjustment to the counter.

''FireTrack'' switches from a non-continuous to a continuous graphics mode part way down the display. By using the palette to mask the top area of the display and taking care about when it changes mode it can shift the continuous graphics at the bottom of the display down in two pixel increments because the internal display counter is not incremented on blank scanlines during non-continuous graphics modes.

====Exile: sampled speech====
''[[Exile (1988 video game)|Exile]]'' turns the Electron's one channel output into a digital speaker for [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] output.

The speaker can be programmatically switched on or off at any time but is permanently attached to a hardware counter so is normally only able to output a square wave. But if set to a frequency outside the human audible range then the ear can't perceive the square wave, only the difference between the speaker being switched on and off. This gives the effect of a simple toggle speaker similar to that seen in the 48&amp;nbsp;kB [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]]. ''Exile'' uses this to output 1-bit audio samples.

====Frak! and Zalaga: Polyphonic music====
Aardvark Software's &quot;[[Frak!]]&quot; and &quot;Zalaga&quot; As part of the copy protection, illegal copies of the games would cause a pseudo-polyphonic rendition of Trumpet Hornpipe, the Captain Pugwash theme tune, to play endlessly rather than loading the game properly (Pugwash being a pirate). On the Electron version of Frak!, the tune was the main theme from &quot;Benny Hill&quot; ([[Boots Randolph]]'s &quot;[[Yakety Sax]]&quot;). The polyphony was achieved via fast note-switching to achieve the necessary chords.

==Popular games==
{{see also|List of Acorn Electron games}}
Although not as well supported by the biggest software publishers as rivals like the [[Commodore 64]] and [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], a good range of games were available for the Electron. The traditional [[BBC Micro]] publishers such as [[Acornsoft]], [[Superior Software]] and [[Micro Power]] offered the widest support. Notable popular games particularly associated with the Electron include:[[File:CrystalCastles Electron.gif|thumb|''[[Crystal Castles (video game)|Crystal Castles]]'' is an example of a popular arcade game officially ported to the Electron (US Gold).]]
* ''[[Starship Command]]'' ([[Acornsoft]], 1983)
* ''[[Chuckie Egg]]'' (A'n'F, 1984)
* ''[[Elite (video game)|Elite]]'' ([[Acornsoft]], 1984)
* the ''[[Repton (video game)|Repton]]'' series ([[Superior Software]], 1985–1989)
* ''[[Thrust (video game)|Thrust]]'' ([[Superior Software]], 1986)
* ''[[Exile (1988 video game)|Exile]]'' ([[Superior Software]], 1988)

There were also many popular games officially converted to the Electron from arcade machines (including ''[[Crystal Castles (video game)|Crystal Castles]]'', ''[[Tempest (arcade game)|Tempest]]'', ''[[Commando (arcade game)|Commando]]'', ''[[Paperboy (video game)|Paperboy]]'' and ''[[Yie Ar Kung-Fu]]'') or other home computer systems (including ''[[Impossible Mission]]'', ''[[Jet Set Willy]]'', ''[[The Way of the Exploding Fist]]'', ''[[Tetris]]'', ''[[The Last Ninja]]'', ''[[Barbarian (computer game)|Barbarian]]'' and ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]'').

Despite Acorn themselves effectively shelving the Electron in 1985, games continued to be developed and released by professional software houses until 1991. There were around 1,400 games released for the Acorn Electron, several thousand extra public domain titles were released on disc through Public Domain libraries. Notable enterprises which produced discs of such software are [[BBC PD]], [[EUG (Electron User Group)|Electron User Group]] and [[HeadFirst PD]].

'''''A Fire Upon the Deep''''' is a science fiction novel by American writer [[Vernor Vinge]], a [[space opera]] involving [[superhuman intelligence]]s, [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], variable physics, space battles, love, betrayal, genocide, and a conversation medium resembling [[Usenet]]. ''A Fire Upon the Deep'' won the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Hugo Award]] in 1993 (tied with ''[[Doomsday Book (novel)|Doomsday Book]]'' by [[Connie Willis]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;WWE-1993&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Besides the normal print book editions, the novel was also included on a [[CD-ROM]] sold by [[ClariNet|ClariNet Communications]] along with the other nominees for the 1993 Hugo awards. The CD-ROM edition included numerous annotations by Vinge on his thoughts and intentions about different parts of the book, and was later released as a standalone eBook (no longer available) in Mobipocket format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.slashdot.org/books/03/09/18/0411259.shtml Review of the annotated ebook edition of ''A Fire Upon the Deep''] at [[Slashdot]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==
The novel is set in various locations in the [[Milky Way]]. The galaxy is divided into four concentric volumes called the &quot;Zones of Thought&quot;; it is not clear to the novel's characters if this is a natural phenomenon or an artificially-produced one, but it seems to roughly correspond with galactic-scale stellar density and a Beyond region is mentioned in the [[Sculptor Galaxy]] as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;sculptor&quot;/&gt; The Zones reflect fundamental differences in basic physical laws, and one of the main consequences is their effect on intelligence, both biological and artificial. Artificial intelligence and automation is most directly affected, in that advanced hardware and software from the Beyond or the Transcend will work less and less well as a ship &quot;descends&quot; towards the Unthinking Depths. But even biological intelligence is affected to a lesser degree. The four zones are spoken of in terms of &quot;low&quot; to &quot;high&quot; as follows:
* The '''Unthinking Depths''' are the innermost zone, surrounding the [[Galactic Core|galactic core]]. In it, only minimal forms of intelligence, biological or otherwise, are possible. This means that any ship straying into the Depths will be stranded, effectively permanently. Even if the crew did not die immediately--and some forms of life native to &quot;higher&quot; Zones would likely do so--they would be rendered incapable of even human intelligence, leaving them unable to operate their ship in any meaningful way.
* Surrounding the Depths is the '''Slow Zone'''. The [[Earth]] (called &quot;Old Earth&quot;) is located in this Zone, and humanity is said to have originated there, although Earth plays no significant role in the story. Biological intelligence is possible in &quot;the Slowness&quot;, but not true, sentient, [[artificial intelligence]]. [[Faster than light travel|Faster-than-light travel]] may not be initiated in the Slow Zone, i.e., one may &quot;jump&quot; into the Slow Zone, but not back out. All ships which find themselves in the Slow Zone are restricted to sub-light speeds. [[Faster-than-light communication]] is impossible into or out of the Slow Zone. As the boundaries of the Zones are unknown and subject to change, accidental entry to the Slow Zone is a major interstellar navigational hazard at the &quot;Bottom&quot; of the Beyond.  Starships which operate near the Beyond/Slow Zone border often have an auxiliary [[Bussard ramjet]] drive, so that, if they accidentally stray into the Slow Zone (thus disabling any FTL drive), they will at least have a backup (sub-light) drive to push them back 'up' to the Beyond. Such ships also tend to include &quot;[[suspended animation|coldsleep]]&quot; equipment, as it is likely that any such return will still take many subjective lifetimes for most species.
* The next outermost layer is the '''Beyond''', within which artificial intelligence, faster-than-light travel and faster-than-light communication, and [[antigravity]] are possible. A few human civilizations exist in the Beyond, all descended from a single ethnic [[Norway|Norwegian]] group which managed to travel from the Slow Zone to the Beyond (presumably at sub-light speeds) and thence spread using FTL travel. The original settlement of this group is known as Nyjora; other human settlements in the Beyond include Straumli Realm and Sjandra Kei. In the Beyond, FTL travel is accomplished by making many small &quot;jumps&quot; across intervening space, and the efficiency of the drive increases the farther a ship travels from the galactic core. This reflects increases in both drive efficiency and the ship's automation's increased capacity as one moves outward, enabling the computation of longer and longer jumps. The Beyond is not a homogeneous zone -- many references are made to, e.g., the 'High Beyond' or the 'Bottom of the Beyond', depending on distance to the galactic core. These terms seem to refer to differences in the Zone itself, not just relative distance from the Core, but there are no obvious Zone boundaries within the Beyond the way there are between the Slow Zone and the Beyond, or between the Beyond and the Transcend. Whereas a ship that crosses from the Beyond to the Slow Zone or vice versa will experience a dramatic change in its capabilities, a ship in the Beyond which moves farther from the Core will experience a gradual increase in efficiency (assuming it has the technology to make use of it) until another major shift at the boundary to the Transcend. The Beyond is populated by a very large number of interstellar and intergalactic&lt;ref name=&quot;sculptor&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vinge|first1=Vernor|title=A Fire Upon the Deep|quote=Relay was now the main intermediate to the Magellanics, and one of the few sites with any sort of link to the Beyond in [[Sculptor Galaxy|Sculptor]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; civilizations which are linked by a faster-than-light communication network, &quot;the Net,&quot; sometimes cynically called the &quot;Net of a Million Lies&quot;. The Net does connect with the Transcend, on the off-chance that one of the &quot;Powers&quot; that live there deigns to communicate, but has no connections with the Slow Zone, as FTL communication is impossible into or out of that Zone. In the novel, the Net is depicted as working much like the [[Usenet]] network in the early 1990s, with transcripts of messages containing header and footer information as one would find in such forums. 
* The outermost layer, containing the [[galactic halo]], is the '''Transcend''', within which incomprehensible, [[Superintelligence|superintelligent]] beings dwell. When a &quot;Beyonder&quot; civilization reaches the point of [[technological singularity]], it is said to &quot;Transcend,&quot; becoming a &quot;Power.&quot; Such Powers always seem to relocate to the Transcend, seemingly necessarily, where they become engaged in affairs which remain entirely mysterious to those that remain in the Beyond.

==Plot==
An expedition from Straumli Realm, an ambitious young human civilization in the Beyond just inside the Transcend border, investigates a five-billion-year-old data archive in the Transcend that offers the possibility of unimaginable riches. The expedition's facility, called High Lab, is gradually compromised by a dormant super-intelligent entity (actually encoded within the archive) later known as the Blight. The Blight rapidly learns how to infiltrate and control the computer systems of High Lab, and even develops the ability to possess and control the living humans. The novel starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of this [[superintelligence]] through exponentially accelerating developmental stages, culminating in a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], nigh-[[omnipotent]] power that is unfathomable to mere humans. Shortly before its final &quot;flowering&quot;, the changes in 10 seconds of the Blight's life are said to exceed those of 10,000 years of human civilization.

Recognizing the danger of what they have awakened, the researchers at High Lab attempt to flee in two ships. Suspicious, the Blight discovers that one of the ships contains a data storage device in its cargo manifest; assuming it contains information that could harm it, the Blight destroys the ship. The second ship is allowed to escape, unharmed, as the Blight assumes that it is no threat; but later realizes that it actually held a &quot;countermeasure&quot;, one of the few things in the universe that the Blight fears.

The ship lands on a distant planet with a [[Middle Ages|medieval]]-level civilization of dog-like creatures dubbed &quot;Tines&quot;, who live in packs as [[Group mind (science fiction)|group minds]]. The ship is revealed to be a [[sleeper ship]], carrying most of High Lab's children in &quot;[[suspended animation|coldsleep boxes]]&quot;. The boxes are rapidly failing and the surviving adults begin unloading them, but are killed when one of two rival forces of Tines seize the ship.  The faction that initially contacts the humans, led by a Tine known as Steel, kills the adults and destroys many of the coldsleep boxes. They also capture a boy named Jefri Olsndot, whom Steel intended on killing but eventually exploits in order to develop advanced technology (such as [[cannon]] and radio communication). Jefri's older sister, Johanna, is rescued by Pilgrim and Scriber, wandering Tines who bring her to the rival faction, led by Woodcarver. She is asked to help develop technology that could gain the upper hand in the impending war.

A distress signal from the sleeper ship eventually reaches &quot;Relay&quot;, a major node in the galactic communications network. A benign transcendent entity (known as a &quot;Power&quot;) named &quot;Old One&quot; contacts Relay, seeking information about the Blight and the humans who released it.  Old One constructs a seemingly human man, Pham Nuwen, to act as its agent.  Pham and Ravna Bergsndot – a human employee of Relay's owners, the wealthy Vrinimi Organization – trace the sleeper ship's signal to the Tines world. Vrinimi Org helps modify a vessel, the ''Out of Band II'', to reach the Tines world and to investigate what the ship carried with it from the High Lab.

The Blight attacks Relay and Old One. Old One has given Pham the information necessary to activate the Blight Countermeasure subconsciously, a process known as ''godshatter'' (which will result in his death). Pham and Ravna escape Relay's destruction in the ''Out of Band II''. After arriving at the Tines homeworld and allying with Woodcarver to defeat Steel, Pham initiates the Countermeasure, which extends the Slow Zone by thousands of light-years to enclose the Blight.  This ends the threat of the Blight at the cost of wrecking thousands of uninvolved civilizations, causing trillions of deaths and potentially the extinction of several galactic races.  The process strands the other humans on the Tines world, now in the depths of the &quot;Slow Zone&quot; where rescue by an advanced civilization is impossible.

Just before Pham dies, he realises that although his body is a reconstruction, the memories implanted by Old One are real. Vinge expands on Pham's backstory in ''[[A Deepness in the Sky]]''.

== Intelligent Species ==
;Aprahanti
A race of humanoids with colorful butterfly-like wings who attempt to use the chaos of the Blight to reestablish their waning hegemony. Despite their attractive, delicate appearance and initial demeanor, the Aprahanti are revealed to be an extremely fearsome and vicious species.

;Blight, The (Super-intelligence)
A representative being of a dormant super-intelligent entity group. Such super-intelligences can rapidly infiltrate and control the computer systems of less technologically advanced species, and even develop the ability to possess and control biological beings. Such super-intelligences are effectively immortal, nigh-omnipotent and transcendent.

;Dirokimes
Older race of inward dreamers, original inhabitants of Sjandra Kei.

;Humans
All humans in the novel (except Pham) are descended from Nyjoran stock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vinge|first=Vernor|title=A fire Upon the Deep|year=1992|publisher=Tom Doherty Associates|location=New York|isbn=0812515285|lccn=91-39020|page=62|edition=1st mass market}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ancestors were &quot;Tuvo-Norsk&quot; asteroid miners from Old Earth's solar system, which is noted as being on the other side of the galaxy in the Slow Zone. (''Nyjora'' sounds similar to [[New Norwegian]] &quot;New Earth&quot;.) One of the major human habitations is Sjandra Kei, three systems&lt;ref&gt;p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; comprising roughly 28 billion&lt;ref&gt;p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; individuals. Their main language is [[Norwegian language|Samnorsk]], the Norwegian term for a hypothetical unification of the [[Bokmål]] and [[Nynorsk]] forms of the language. (Vinge indicates in the book's dedication that several key ideas in it came to him while at a conference in Tromsø, Norway.)

;Skroders / Riders / Skroderiders
A [[Sessility (limnology)|sessile]] race of trees with fronds that are used for expression. 5 billion years ago, the Blight gave them wheeled mechanical constructs (skrodes) to move and as short-term memory, and the destruction of the Blight survived as their founding myth. The Blight is able to corrupt and operate the Riders via their Skrodes.

;Tines
A [[Canidae|canid]] race, each 'person' comprising a group mind of 4-8 individuals, connected by ultrasonic waves. Each 'soul' will last as long as it has enough members, potentially hundreds of years.

==Related works==
Vinge first used the concepts of &quot;Zones of Thought&quot;  in a 1988 novella, &quot;[[The Blabber]]&quot;, which occurs after ''Fire''. Vinge's novel, ''[[A Deepness in the Sky]]'' (1999), is a prequel to ''A Fire Upon the Deep'' set 20,000 years earlier and featuring Pham Nuwen. Vinge's ''[[The Children of the Sky]]'', &quot;a near-term sequel to ''A Fire Upon the Deep''&quot;, set ten years later, was released in October 2011.&lt;ref name=Norwescon33&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norwescon.org/archives/norwescon33/vingeinterview.htm|title=Interview with Vernor Vinge|date=October 12, 2009|publisher=[[Norwescon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aeronautics''' (from the [[ancient Greek]] words ὰήρ ''āēr'', which means &quot;air&quot;, and ναυτική ''nautikē'' which means &quot;navigation&quot;, i.e. &quot;navigation of the air&quot;) is the science or art involved with the study, [[aircraft design process|design]], and manufacturing of air[[flight]]-capable machines, and the techniques of operating [[aircraft]] and rockets within the atmosphere. The British [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] identifies the aspects of &quot;aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering&quot; and &quot;the profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes Astronautics).&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://aerosociety.com/About-Us/learnedsociety A Learned and Professional Society] (Retrieved 8 March 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term—literally meaning &quot;sailing the air&quot;—originally referred solely to the science of ''operating'' the aircraft, it has since been expanded to include technology, business and other aspects related to aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
 | title = Aeronautics
 | volume = 1
 | pages = 226
 | year = 1986
 | publisher = Grolier }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The term &quot;[[aviation]]&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with aeronautics, although &quot;aeronautics&quot; includes [[lighter-than-air]] craft such as [[airship]]s, and includes [[ballistic vehicle]]s while &quot;aviation&quot; technically does not.&lt;ref name=&quot;americana&quot;/&gt;

A significant part of '''aeronautical science''' is a branch of [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] called [[aerodynamics]], which deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.

==History==

===Early ideas===
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci helicopter and lifting wing.jpg|thumb|right|Designs for flying machines by Leonardo da Vinci, circa 1490]] 

Attempts to fly without any real aeronautical understanding have been made from the earliest times, typically by constructing wings and jumping from a tower with crippling or lethal results.{{sfn|Wragg|1974}}

Wiser investigators sought to gain some rational understanding through the study of bird flight. An early example appears in ancient Egyptian texts.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Later medieval Islamic scientists also made such studies. The founders of modern aeronautics, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] in the Renaissance and Cayley around 1800, both began their investigations with studies of bird flight.

Man-carrying kites are believed to have been used extensively in ancient China. In 1282 the European explorer [[Marco Polo]] described the Chinese techniques then current.&lt;ref name=&quot;pelham&quot;&gt;Pelham, D.; ''The Penguin book of kites'', Penguin (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese also constructed small hot air balloons, or lanterns, and rotary-wing toys.

An early European to provide any scientific discussion of flight was [[Roger Bacon]], who described principles of operation for the lighter-than-air [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] and the flapping-wing [[ornithopter]], which he envisaged would be constructed in the future. The lifting medium for his balloon would be an &quot;aether&quot; whose composition he did not know.{{sfn|Wragg|1974|pp=10–11}}

In the late fifteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci followed up his study of birds with designs for some of the earliest flying machines, including the flapping-wing [[ornithopter]] and the rotating-wing [[helicopter]]. Although his designs were rational, they were not based on particularly good science.{{sfn|Wragg|1974|p=11}} Many of his designs, such as a four-person screw-type helicopter, have severe flaws. He did at least understand that &quot;An object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object.&quot;{{sfn|Fairlie|Cayley|1965|p=163}} ([[Isaac Newton|Newton]] would not publish the [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s third law|Third law of motion]] until 1687.) His analysis led to the realisation that manpower alone was not sufficient for sustained flight, and his later designs included a mechanical power source such as a spring. Da Vinci's work was lost after his death and did not reappear until it had been overtaken by the work of [[George Cayley]].

===Balloon flight===
{{Main|History of ballooning}}
[[File:Flying boat.png|thumb|right|upright|Francesco Lana de Terzi's flying boat concept c.1670]]
The modern era of lighter-than-air flight began early in the 17th century with [[Galileo]]'s experiments in which he showed that air has weight. Around 1650 [[Cyrano de Bergerac]] wrote some fantasy novels in which he described the principle of ascent using a substance (dew) he supposed to be lighter than air, and descending by releasing a controlled amount of the substance.{{sfn|Ege|1973|p=6}} [[Francesco Lana de Terzi]] measured the pressure of air at sea level and in 1670 proposed the first scientifically credible lifting medium in the form of hollow metal spheres from which all the air had been pumped out. These would be lighter than the displaced air and able to lift an [[airship]]. His proposed methods of controlling height are still in use today; by carrying ballast which may be dropped overboard to gain height, and by venting the lifting containers to lose height.{{sfn|Ege|1973|p=7}} In practice de Terzi's spheres would have collapsed under air pressure, and further developments had to wait for more practicable lifting gases.

From the mid-18th century the [[Montgolfier brothers]] in France began experimenting with balloons. Their balloons were made of paper, and early experiments using steam as the lifting gas were short-lived due to its effect on the paper as it condensed. Mistaking smoke for a kind of steam, they began filling their balloons with hot smoky air which they called &quot;electric smoke&quot; and, despite not fully understanding the principles at work, made some successful launches and in 1783 were invited to give a demonstration to the French Academie des Sciences.

Meanwhile the discovery of [[hydrogen]] led [[Joseph Black]] in c. 1780 to propose its use as a lifting gas, though practical demonstration awaited a gastight balloon material. On hearing of the Montgolfier Brothers' invitation, the French Academy member [[Jacques Charles]] offered a similar demonstration of a hydrogen balloon. Charles and two craftsmen, the Robert brothers, developed a gastight material of rubberised silk for the envelope. The hydrogen gas was to be generated by chemical reaction during the filling process.

The Montgolfier designs had several shortcomings, not least the need for dry weather and a tendency for sparks from the fire to set light to the paper balloon. The manned design had a gallery around the base of the balloon rather than the hanging basket of the first, unmanned design, which brought the paper closer to the fire. On their free flight, De Rozier and d'Arlandes took buckets of water and sponges to douse these fires as they arose. On the other hand, the manned design of Charles was essentially modern.{{sfn|Ege|1973|pp=97–100}} As a result of these exploits, the hot-air ballon became known as the ''Montgolfière'' type and the hydrogen balloon the ''Charlière''.

Charles and the Robert brothers' next balloon, ''[[Robert brothers#Further ballooning activities – La Caroline|La Caroline]]'', was a Charlière that followed [[Jean Baptiste Meusnier]]'s proposals for an elongated dirigible balloon, and was notable for having an outer envelope with the gas contained in a second, inner ballonet. On 19 September 1784, it completed the first flight of over 100&amp;nbsp;km, between Paris and [[Beuvry]], despite the man-powered propulsive devices proving useless.

In an attempt the next year to provide both endurance and controllability, de Rozier developed a balloon having both hot air and hydrogen gas bags, a design which was soon named after him as the ''Rozière.'' The principle was to use the hydrogen section for constant lift and to navigate vertically by heating and allowing to cool the hot air section, in order to catch the most favourable wind at whatever altitude it was blowing. The balloon envelope was made of [[goldbeaters skin]]. The first flight ended in disaster and the approach has seldom been used since.{{sfn|Ege|1965|p=105}}

===Cayley and the foundation of modern aeronautics===
[[Sir George Cayley]] (1773-1857) is widely acknowledged as the founder of modern aeronautics. He was first called the &quot;father of the aeroplane&quot; in 1846{{sfn|Fairlie|Cayley|1965}} and Henson called him the &quot;father of aerial navigation.&quot;{{sfn|Wragg|1974}} He was the first true scientific aerial investigator to publish his work, which included for the first time the underlying principles and forces of flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Sir George Carley| url = http://www.flyingmachines.org/cayl.html| publisher = Flyingmachines.org| accessdate = 2009-07-26| quote = Sir George Cayley is one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics. Many consider him the first true scientific aerial investigator and the first person to understand the underlying principles and forces of flight.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1809 he began the publication of a landmark three-part treatise titled &quot;On Aerial Navigation&quot; (1809–1810).&lt;ref name=&quot;AerNav123&quot;&gt;''Cayley, George''. &quot;On Aerial Navigation&quot; [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf Part 1], [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf Part 2], [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf Part 3] ''Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy'', 1809–1810. (Via [[NASA]]). [http://invention.psychology.msstate.edu/i/Cayley/Cayley.html Raw text]. Retrieved: 30 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In it he wrote the first scientific statement of the problem, &quot;The whole problem is confined within these limits, viz. to make a surface support a given weight by the application of power to the resistance of air.&quot; He identified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft: ''[[thrust]]'', ''[[Lift (force)|lift]]'', ''[[Aerodynamic drag|drag]]'' and ''[[weight]]'' and distinguished stability and control in his designs.

He developed the modern conventional form of the fixed-wing aeroplane having a stabilising tail with both horizontal and vertical surfaces, flying gliders both unmanned and manned.

He introduced the use of the whirling arm test rig to investigate the aerodynamics of flight, using it to discover the benefits of the curved or [[camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] [[aerofoil]] over the flat wing he had used for his first glider. He also identified and described the importance of [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]], diagonal bracing and drag reduction, and contributed to the understanding and design of [[ornithopter]]s and [[parachute]]s.{{sfn|Wragg|1974}}

Another significant invention was the tension-spoked wheel, which he devised in order to create a light, strong wheel for aircraft undercarriage.

===The 19th century===
During the 19th century Cayley's ideas were refined, proved and expanded on. Important investigators included [[Otto Lilienthal]] and [[Horatio Phillips]].

==Branches==
Aeronautics may be divided into three main branches comprising [[Aviation]], [[Aeronautical science]] and [[Aeronautical engineering]].

===Aviation===
{{Main|Aviation}}

Aviation is the art or practice of aeronautics. Historically aviation meant only heavier-than-air flight, but nowadays it includes flying in balloons and airships.

===Aeronautical science===

Aeronautical science covers the practical theory of aeronautics and aviation, including operations, navigation, air safety and human factors.

A candidate pilot is likely to study for a qualification in aeronautical science.

===Aeronautical engineering===
{{Main|Aerospace engineering}}

Aeronautical engineering covers the design and construction of aircraft, including how they are powered, how they are used and how they are controlled for safe operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gla.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/aeronauticalengineering/ Aeronautical engineering], University of Glasgow.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major part of aeronautical engineering is aerodynamics, the science of passage through the air.

With the increasing activity in spaceflight, nowadays aeronautics and astronautics are often combined as [[aerospace engineering]].

==== Aerodynamics ====
{{Main|Aerodynamics}}
The science of aerodynamics deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.

The study of aerodynamics falls broadly into three areas:

''[[Incompressible flow]]'' occurs where the air simply moves to avoid objects, typically at subsonic speeds below that of sound (Mach 1).

''[[Compressible flow]]'' occurs where shock waves appear at points where the air becomes compressed, typically at speeds above Mach 1.

''[[Transonic flow]]'' occurs in the intermediate speed range around Mach 1, where the airflow over an object may be locally subsonic at one point and locally supersonic at another.

=== Rocketry ===
{{See also|Rocket}}
[[File:Apollo 15 launch.ogg|thumb|right|Launch of ''[[Apollo 15]]'' [[Saturn V]] rocket: ''T'' - 30 s through ''T'' + 40 s.]]

A [[rocket]] or rocket vehicle is a [[missile]], spacecraft, [[aircraft]] or other [[vehicle]] which obtains [[thrust]] from a [[rocket engine]]. In all rockets, the exhaust is formed entirely from [[propellant]]s carried within the rocket before use.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPE7&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Sutton | first = George | title = Rocket Propulsion Elements |edition=7th |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LQbDOxg3XZcC&amp;printsec=frontcover | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-471-32642-7|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rocket engines work by [[Reaction (physics)|action and reaction]]. Rocket engines push rockets forwards simply by throwing their exhaust backwards extremely fast.

Rockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th century [[China]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA EARLY&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|MSFC History Office}} &quot;Rockets in Ancient Times (100 B.C. to 17th Century)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Significant scientific, interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century, when rocketry was the enabling technology of the [[Space Age]], including [[Apollo 11|setting foot on the moon]].

Rockets are used for [[fireworks]], weaponry, [[ejection seat]]s, [[launch vehicle]]s for [[artificial satellite]]s, [[human spaceflight]] and [[Space exploration|exploration]] of other planets. While comparatively inefficient for low speed use, they are very lightweight and powerful, capable of generating large accelerations and of attaining [[escape velocity|extremely high speeds]] with reasonable efficiency.

[[Chemical rocket]]s are the most common type of rocket and they typically create their exhaust by the combustion of [[rocket propellant]]. Chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form, and can be very dangerous. However, careful design, testing, construction and use minimizes risks.

==History==
The Lumière brothers were born in [[Besançon]], [[France]] to '''Claude-Antoine Lumière''' and '''Jeanne Joséphine Costille Lumière'''. They moved to [[Lyon]] in 1870, where both attended [[La Martiniere Lyon|La Martiniere]], the largest technical school in Lyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Motion Pictures | author = Gina De Angelis | publisher = The Oliver Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-1-881508-78-6 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=daHmkclqERYC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=Lumi%C3%A8re+Besan%C3%A7on+Lyon&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=eqdfSaiYK4PAlQTF4tj7BQ#PPA34,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their father, Claude-Antoine Lumière (1840–1911), ran a [[History of the camera|photographic]] firm where both brothers worked for him: Louis as a physicist and Auguste as a manager. Louis had made some improvements to the still-photograph process, the most notable being the dry-plate process, which was a major step towards moving images.

[[File:Institut Lumière - CINEMATOGRAPHE Camera.jpg|thumb|Cinématographe Lumière at the [[Institut Lumière]], France]]
It was not until their father retired in 1892 that the brothers began to create moving pictures. They patented a number of significant processes leading up to their film camera, most notably [[film perforations]] (originally implemented by [[Emile Reynaud]]) as a means of advancing the film through the camera and projector. The original [[cinématographe]] had been patented by [[Léon Guillaume Bouly]] on 12 February 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Brevet FR 219.350 |url=http://cinematographes.free.fr/bouly-219350.html |quote= |publisher=''Cinematographes'' |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The brothers patented their own version on 13 February 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Brevet FR 245.032 |url=http://cinematographes.free.fr/lumiere-245032.html |quote= |publisher=''Cinematographes'' |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first footage ever to be recorded using it was recorded on March 19, 1895. This first film shows workers leaving the Lumière factory.

==First film screenings==
The Lumières held their first private screening of projected motion pictures in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Chardère (1985), p.71. This first screening on March 22, 1895 took place in Paris, at the &quot;Society for the Development of the National Industry&quot;, in front of an audience of 200 people – among which [[Léon Gaumont]], then director of the Comptoir de la photographie. The main focus of this conference by Louis Lumière were the recent developments in the photograph industry, mainly the research on polychromy (color photography). It was much to Lumière's surprise that the moving black-and-white images retained more attention than the colored stills photographs.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their first public screening of films at which admission was charged was held on December 28, 1895, at [[Salon Indien du Grand Café]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/presentation-du-cinematographe-lumiere/ December 28, 1895.]&lt;/ref&gt; This history-making presentation featured ten short films, including their first film, ''[[Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory|Sortie des Usines Lumière à Lyon]]'' (''Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html &quot;La première séance publique payante&quot;, Institut Lumière]&lt;/ref&gt; Each film is 17 meters long, which, when hand cranked through a projector, runs approximately 50 seconds.

[[Image:Cinématographe Lumière.jpg|thumb|right|190px|The world's first film poster, for 1895's ''[[L'Arroseur arrosé]]'']] It is believed their first film was actually recorded that same year (1895)&lt;ref&gt;Chardère (1987), p.70: The date of the recording of their first film is in dispute. In an interview with Georges Sadoul given in 1948, Louis Lumière tells that he shot the film in August 1894. This is questioned by historians (Sadoul, Pinel, Chardère) who consider that a functional Lumière camera didn't exist before the end of 1894, and that their first film was recorded March 19th 1895, and then publicly projected March 22nd at the Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale in Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Léon Bouly]]'s [[cinematographe|cinématographe]] device, which was patented the previous year. The cinématographe — a three-in-one device that could record, develop, and project [[film|motion picture]]s — was further developed by the Lumières.

The public debut at the Grand Café came a few months later and consisted of the following ten short films (in order of presentation):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institut-lumiere.org/francais/films/1seance/accueil.html Bienvenue sur Adobe GoLive 4]. Institut-lumiere.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

#''[[Workers Leaving the Lumière Factory|La Sortie de l'Usine Lumière à Lyon]]'' (literally, &quot;the exit from the Lumière factory in Lyon&quot;, or, under its more common English title, ''Workers Leaving the Lumiere Factory''), 46 seconds
#''Le Jardinier ([[l'Arroseur Arrosé]])'' (&quot;The Gardener&quot;, or &quot;The Sprinkler Sprinkled&quot;), 49 seconds

#''[[La Voltige]]'' (&quot;Horse Trick Riders&quot;), 46 seconds
#''[[La Pêche aux poissons rouges]]'' (&quot;fishing for goldfish&quot;), 42 seconds
#''[[Les Forgerons]]'' (&quot;Blacksmiths&quot;), 49 seconds
#''[[Repas de bébé]]'' (&quot;Baby's Breakfast&quot; (lit. &quot;baby's meal&quot;)), 41 seconds
#''[[Le Saut à la couverture]]'' (&quot;Jumping Onto the Blanket&quot;), 41 seconds

#''[[La Mer (film)|La Mer (Baignade en mer)]]'' (&quot;the sea [bathing in the sea]&quot;), 38 seconds

The Lumières went on tour with the cinématographe in 1896, visiting [[Brussels]] (the first place a movie was played outside Paris on the Galleries Saint-Hubert on March 1. 1896), [[Bombay]], [[London]], [[Montreal]], [[New York]] and [[Buenos Aires]].

The moving images had an immediate and significant influence on popular culture with ''[[L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat]]'' (literally, &quot;the arrival of a train at La Ciotat&quot;, but more commonly known as ''Arrival of a Train at a Station'') and ''[[Carmaux, défournage du coke]]'' (Drawing out the coke). Their [[actuality film]]s, or ''actualités'', are often cited as the first, primitive [[documentaries]]. They also made the first steps towards comedy film with the slapstick of ''[[L'Arroseur Arrosé]]''.

==Early color photography==

The brothers stated that &quot;the [[film|cinema]] is an [[invention]] without any future&quot; and declined to sell their camera to other filmmakers such as [[Georges Méliès]]. This made many film makers upset. Consequently, their role in the history of film was exceedingly brief. They turned their attentions to color photography and in 1903 they patented a color photography process, the &quot;[[Autochrome Lumière]]&quot;, launched on the market in 1907. Throughout much of the 20th century, the Lumière company was a major producer of photographic products in Europe, but the brand name, Lumière, disappeared from the marketplace following  merger with [[Ilford Photo|Ilford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdx.rhonealpes.fr/sdx/sribzh/main.xsp?execute=show_document&amp;id=MERIMEEIA69000030 City of Lyon Document]&lt;/ref&gt; They also invented the color plate which really got photography on the road.

==Other early cinematographers==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2010}}
The Lumière Brothers were not the only ones to claim the title of the first cinematographers. The scientific [[chronophotography]] devices developed by [[Eadweard Muybridge]], [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] and [[Ottomar Anschütz]] in the 1880s were able to produce moving photographs, as was [[William Friese-Greene]]'s 'chronophotographic' system, demonstrated in 1890, and [[Thomas Edison]]'s [[Kinetoscope]] (developed by W K-L Dickson), premiered in 1891. Since 1892, the projected drawings of [[Émile Reynaud]]'s [[Théâtre Optique]] were attracting Paris crowds to the Museé Grevin. [[Louis Le Prince]] and [[Claude Mechant]] had been shooting moving picture sequences on paper film as soon as 1888, but had never performed a public demonstration. Polish inventor, [[Kazimierz Prószyński]] had built his camera and projecting device, called [[Pleograph]], in 1894. [[Max Skladanowsky|Max and Emil Skladanowsky]], inventors of the [[Bioscop]], had offered projected moving images to a paying public one month earlier (November 1, 1895, in [[Berlin]]). Nevertheless, film historians consider the Grand Café screening to be the true birth of the cinema as a commercial medium, because the Skladanowsky brothers' screening used an extremely impractical dual system motion picture projector that was immediately supplanted by the Lumiere cinematographe.

Although the Lumière brothers were not the first inventors to develop techniques to create motion pictures, they are often credited as among the first inventors of the technology for Cinema as a mass medium, and are among the first who understood how to use it.

{{Books of the New Testament}}
The '''Acts of the Apostles''' ({{lang-grc|Πράξεις τῶν Ἀποστόλων}}, ''Práxeis tôn Apostólōn''; {{lang-la|Āctūs Apostolōrum}}), often referred to simply as '''Acts''', is the fifth book of the [[New Testament]]; it tells of the founding of the Christian church and the spread of its message to the Roman empire.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=263}}

Acts is the second half of a two-part work, referred to as [[Luke-Acts]], by the same anonymous author, referred to as [[Luke the Evangelist]], and usually dated to around 80-90 CE.{{sfn|Charlesworth|2008|p=no page number}}{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=195}} The first part, the [[Gospel of Luke]], tells how [[God in Christianity|God]] fulfilled his plan for the world's [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] through the life, death and resurrection of [[Jesus of Nazareth]], the promised [[Messiah]]. Acts continues the story of [[Christianity in the 1st century]], beginning with the [[Ascension of Christ]]. The early chapters, set in [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], describe the [[Pentecost|Day of Pentecost]] (the coming of the [[Holy Spirit]]) and the growth of the church in Jerusalem. Initially the Jews are receptive to the Christian message, but soon they turn against the followers of the Messiah. Rejected by the Jews, under the guidance of the [[Apostle Peter]] the message is taken to the [[Gentiles]]. The later chapters tell of [[Conversion of Paul the Apostle|Paul's conversion]], his mission in Asia Minor and the Aegean, and finally his imprisonment in Rome, where, as the book ends, he awaits trial.

Luke-Acts is an attempt to answer a theological problem, namely how the Messiah of the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church; the answer it provides, and its central theme, is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the [[Judaism's view of Jesus|Jews rejected it]].{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=263}}

==Composition and setting==
{{Main|Authorship of Luke–Acts}}
[[File:ApostleFedorZubov.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Ministry of the Apostles: [[Russian icons|Russian icon]] by [[Fyodor Zubov]], 1660]]

===Title, unity of Luke-Acts, authorship and date===
The title &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; ([[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Πράξεις ἀποστόλων}} ''Praxeis Apostolon'') was first used by [[Irenaeus]] in the late 2nd century. It is not known whether this was an existing title or one invented by Irenaeus; it does seem clear, however, that it was not given by the author.{{sfn|Matthews|2011|p=12}}

The gospel of Luke and Acts make up a two-volume work which scholars call [[Luke-Acts]].{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=195}} Together they account for 27.5% of the [[New Testament]], the largest contribution attributed to a single author, providing the framework for both the Church's liturgical calendar and the historical outline into which later generations have fitted their idea of the story of Jesus and the early church.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=556}}

The author is not named in either volume.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=196}} According to Church tradition dating from the 2nd century, he was the &quot;Luke&quot; named as a companion of the [[apostle Paul]] in three of the letters attributed to Paul himself; this view is still sometimes advanced, but &quot;a critical consensus emphasizes the countless contradictions between the account in Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.&quot;{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=32}} (An example can be seen by comparing Acts' accounts of Paul's conversion (Acts 9:1-31, 22:6-21, and 26:9-23) with Paul's own statement that he remained unknown to Christians in Judea after that event (Galatians 1:17-24).){{sfn|Perkins|1998|p=253}} He admired Paul, but his theology was significantly different from Paul's on key points and he does not (in Acts) represent Paul's views accurately.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=590}} He was educated, a man of means, probably urban, and someone who respected manual work, although not a worker himself; this is significant, because more high-brow writers of the time looked down on the artisans and small business-people who made up the early church of Paul and were presumably Luke's audience.{{sfn|Green|1997|p=35}}

The earliest possible date for the composition of Acts is set by the events with which it ends, Paul's imprisonment in Rome c.63 CE, but an early date is now rarely put forward.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=587}}{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1996 [tr. 1998]|p=32}} The last possible date would be set by its first definite citation by another author, but there is no unanimity on this–some scholars find echoes of Acts in a work from c.95 CE called [[I Clement]], while others see no indisputable citation until the middle of the 2nd century.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=587}} If Acts uses [[Josephus]] as a source, as has been proposed, then it must have been composed after 93 CE; it does not show any knowledge of Paul's letters, a fact which also supports a late date; and the social situation it reflects is one in which the faithful need &quot;shepherds&quot; to protect them from heretical (possibly [[Marcion]]ite) &quot;wolves&quot;, which again reflects a late date.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=587}} Most experts therefore date it to around 80-90 CE, although some suggest 90-110, {{sfn|Charlesworth|2008|p=no page number}} and there is evidence that it was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|p=250-253}}

===Genre, sources and historicity of Acts===
Luke (or more accurately the anonymous author of Luke-Acts) describes his work, Luke-Acts, as a &quot;narrative&quot; (''diegesis''). Acts, the second part, is widely thought of as a history, but it lacks exact analogies in Hellenistic or Jewish literature.{{sfn|Aune|1988|p=77}} The title &quot;Acts of the Apostles&quot; (''Praxeis Apostolon'') would seem to identify it with the genre telling of the deeds and achievements of great men (''praxeis''), but it was not the title given by the author.{{sfn|Matthews|2011|p=12}}

Luke seems to have taken as his model the works of two respected Classical authors, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], who wrote a well-known history of Rome, and the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], author of a [[Antiquities of the Jews|history of the Jews]].{{sfn|Balch|2003|p=1104}} Like them he anchors his history by dating the birth of the founder (Romulus for Dionysius, Moses for Josephus, Jesus for Luke) and like them he tells how the founder is born from God, taught authoritatively, and appeared to witnesses after death before ascending to heaven.{{sfn|Balch|2003|p=1104}} By and large the sources for Acts can only be guessed at,{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=40}} but Luke would have had access to the [[Septuagint]] (a Greek translation of the Jewish scriptures), the [[gospel of Mark]] and the collection of &quot;sayings of Jesus&quot; called the [[Q source]].{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=577}} He transposed a few incidents from Mark's gospel to the time of the Apostles – for example, the material about &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;unclean&quot; foods in Mark 7 is used in Acts 10, and Mark's account of the accusation that Jesus has attacked the Temple (Mark 14:58) is used in a story about Stephen (Acts 6:14).){{sfn|Witherington|1998|p=8}} There are also points of contacts (meaning suggestive parallels but something less than clear evidence) with [[1 Peter]], the [[Letter to the Hebrews]], and 1 Clement.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=578}} Other sources can only be inferred from internal evidence – the traditional explanation of the three &quot;we&quot; passages, for example, is that they represent eye-witness accounts.{{sfn|Bruce|1990|p=40-41}} The search for such inferred sources was popular in the 19th century, but by the mid-20th it had largely been abandoned.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=579}}

Acts was read as a reliable history of the early church well into the post-Reformation era. By the 17th century, however, biblical scholars began to notice that it was incomplete and tendentious – its picture of a harmonious church is quite at odds with that given by Paul's letters, and it omits important events such as the deaths of both Peter and Paul. The mid-19th century scholar [[Ferdinand Christian Baur|Ferdinand Baur]] suggested that Luke had re-written history to present a united Peter and Paul and advance a single orthodoxy against the [[Marcion]]ites. (Marcion was a 2nd-century heretic who wished to cut Christianity off entirely from the Jews). Baur continues to have enormous influence, but today there is less interest in determining Luke's historical accuracy (although this has never died out) than in understanding his theological program.{{sfn|Holladay|2011|p=no page numbers}}

===Audience and authorial intent===
Luke was written to be read aloud to a group of Jesus-followers gathered in a house to share the Lord's supper.{{sfn|Balch|2003|p=1104}} The author assumes an educated Greek-speaking audience, but directs his attention to specifically Christian concerns rather than to the Greco-Roman world at large.{{sfn|Green|1995|p=16-17}} He begins his gospel with a preface addressed to [[Theophilus (biblical)|Theophilus]], informing him of his intention to provide an &quot;ordered account&quot; of events which will lead his reader to &quot;certainty&quot;.{{sfn|Green|1997|p=35}} He did not write in order to provide Theophilus with historical justification – &quot;did it happen?&quot; – but to encourage faith – &quot;what happened, and what does it all mean?&quot;{{sfn|Green|1997|p=36}}

Acts (or Luke-Acts) is intended as a work of &quot;edification.&quot;{{sfn|Fitzmyer|1998|p=55-65}} Edification means &quot;the empirical demonstration that virtue is superior to vice,&quot;{{sfn|Aune|1988|p=80}} but is not all of Luke's purpose. He also engages with the question of a Christian's proper relationship with the Roman Empire, the civil power of the day: could a Christian obey God and also Caesar? The answer is ambiguous.{{sfn|Pickett|2011|p=6-7}} The Romans never move against Jesus or his followers unless provoked by the Jews, in the trial scenes the Christian missionaries are always cleared of charges of violating Roman laws, and Acts ends with Paul in Rome proclaiming the Christian message under Roman protection; at the same time, Luke makes clear that the Romans, like all earthly rulers, receive their authority from Satan, while Christ is ruler of the [[kingdom of God]]. {{sfn|Boring|2012|p=562}}

Luke-Acts can be also seen as a defense of (or &quot;apology&quot; for) the Jesus movement addressed to the Jews: the bulk of the speeches and sermons in Acts are addressed to Jewish audiences, with the Romans featuring as external arbiters on disputes concerning Jewish customs and law.{{sfn|Pickett|2011|p=6-7}} On the one hand Luke portrays the Christians as a sect of the Jews, and therefore entitled to legal protection as a recognised religion; on the other, Luke seems unclear as to the future God intends for Jews and Christians, celebrating the Jewishness of Jesus and his immediate followers while also stressing how the Jews had rejected God's promised Messiah.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=563}}

===Manuscripts===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Biblical canon]] --&gt;

There are two major textual variants of Luke-Acts, the [[Western text-type]] and the [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]]. The oldest complete Alexandrian manuscripts date from the 4th century and the oldest Western ones from the 6th, with fragments and citations going back to the 3rd. Western texts of Acts are 10% longer than Alexandrian texts, the additions tending to enhance the Jewish rejection of the Messiah and the role of the Holy Spirit, in ways that are stylistically different from the rest of Acts.{{sfn|Thompson|2010|p=332}} These conflicts suggest that Luke-Acts was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|p=250-253}} The majority of scholars prefer the Alexandrian (shorter) text-type over the Western as the more authentic, but this same argument would favour the Western over the Alexandrian for the gospel of Luke, as in that case the Western version is the shorter. The debate therefore continues.{{sfn|Thompson|2010|p=332}}

==Structure and content==
[[File:Minuscule 223 (GA) f11r.jpg|thumb|left|Acts 1:1-2a from the 14th century [[Minuscule 223]]]]

===Structure===
Acts has two key structural principles. The first is the geographic movement from Jerusalem, centre of God's Covenantal people the Jews, to Rome, centre of the Gentile world. This structure reaches back to the author's preceding work, the [[Gospel of Luke]], and is signaled by parallel scenes such as Paul's utterance in Acts 19:21, which echoes Jesus' words 9:51 (Paul has Rome as his destination, as Jesus had Jerusalem). The second key element is the roles of Peter and Paul, the first representing the Jewish Christian church, the second the mission to the Gentiles.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=569-570}}

===Content===
{{See also|Early Christianity|Jewish Christians}}
The [[Gospel of Luke]] began with a prologue addressed to Theophilus; Acts likewise opens with an address to Theophilus and refers to &quot;my earlier book&quot;, almost certainly the gospel.

The apostles and other followers of Jesus meet and elect Matthias to replace Judas as a member of The Twelve. On [[Pentecost]], the [[Holy Spirit]] descends and confers God's power on them, and Peter, along with John, preaches to many in Jerusalem, and performs Christ-like healings, [[Exorcism|casting out of evil spirits]], and [[Resurrection of the dead|raising of the dead]]. At first many [[Jewish Christians|Jews follow Christ]] and are baptized, but the Christians begin to be increasingly [[Persecution of Christians in the New Testament|persecuted]] by the Jews. [[Saint Stephen|Stephen]] is arrested for [[blasphemy]], and after a trial, is found guilty and [[Stoning|stoned]] by the Jews. Stephen's death marks a major turning point: the Jews have rejected the message, and henceforth it will be taken to the Gentiles.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=265}}

The message is taken to the Samaritans, a people rejected by Jews, and to the [[Gentiles]]. [[Saul of Tarsus]], one of the Jews who persecuted the Christians, is converted by a vision to become a follower of Christ (an event which Luke regards as so important that he relates it three times). Peter, directed by a series of visions, preaches to [[Cornelius the Centurion]], a Gentile God-fearer, who becomes a follower of Christ. The Holy Spirit descends on Peter and Cornelius, thus confirming that the message of eternal life in Christ is for all mankind. The Gentile church is established in Antioch (north-western Syria, the third-largest city of the empire), and here Christ's followers are first called Christians.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=266}}

The mission to the Gentiles is promoted from Antioch and confirmed at [[Council of Jerusalem|meeting in Jerusalem]] between Paul and the leadership of the Jerusalem church. Paul spends the next few years traveling through western Asia Minor and the Aegean,preaching, converting Gentiles, and founding new churches. On a visit to Jerusalem he is set on by a Jewish mob. Saved by the Roman commander, he is accused by the Jews of being a [[zealot|revolutionary]], the &quot;ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes&quot;, and imprisoned. Paul asserts his right as a Roman citizen, to be tried in Rome and is sent by sea to Rome, where he spends another two years under house arrest, proclaiming the [[Kingdom of God]] and teaching the &quot;Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. Acts ends abruptly without recording the outcome of Paul's legal troubles.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Theology==
[[File:Saint Paul.jpg|thumb|235px|left|Paul's conversion, from ''Livre d'Heures d'Étienne Chevalier'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1450–1460), [[Jean Fouquet]], in the [[Château de Chantilly]].]]

Prior to the 1950s Luke-Acts was seen as a historical work, written to defend Christianity before the Romans or Paul against his detractors; since then, however, the tendency has been to see the work as primarily theological.{{sfn|Buckwalter|1996|p=6}} Luke's theology is expressed primarily through his overarching plot, the way scenes, themes and characters combine to construct his specific worldview.{{sfn|Allen|2009|p=326}} His &quot;salvation history&quot; stretches from the Creation to the present time of his readers, in three ages: first, the time of &quot;the Law and the Prophets&quot; (Luke 16:16), the period beginning with Genesis and ending with the appearance of John the Baptist (Luke 1:5-3:1); second, the epoch of Jesus, in which the [[Kingdom of God]] was preached (Luke 3:2-24:51); and finally the period of the Church, which began when the risen Christ was taken into Heaven, and would end with his [[second coming of Christ|second coming]].{{sfn|Evans|2011|p=no page numbers}}

Luke-Acts is an attempt to answer a theological problem, namely how the Messiah promised to the Jews came to have an overwhelmingly non-Jewish church; the answer it provides, and its central theme, is that the message of Christ was sent to the Gentiles because the Jews rejected it.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=263}} This theme is introduced at the opening of the gospel of Luke, when Jesus, rejected in Nazareth, recalls that the prophets were rejected by Israel and accepted by Gentiles; at the end of the gospel he commands his disciples to preach his message to all nations, &quot;beginning from Jerusalem.&quot; He repeats the command in Acts, telling them to preach &quot;in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the Earth.&quot; They then proceed to do so, in the order outlined: first Jerusalem, then Judea, then Samaria, then the entire (Roman) world.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=264}}

For Luke, the Holy Spirit is the driving force behind the spread of the Christian message, and he places more emphasis on it than do any of the other evangelists. The Spirit is &quot;poured out&quot; at [[Pentecost]], on the first Samaritan and Gentile believers, and on disciples who had been baptised only by [[John the Baptist]], each time as a sign of God's approval. The Holy Spirit represents God's power (At his ascension, Jesus tells his followers, &quot;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you&quot;): through it the disciples are given speech to convert thousands in Jerusalem, forming the first church (the term is used for the first time in Acts 5).{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=268-270}}

===Gospel of Luke===
As the second part of the two-part work Luke-Acts, Acts has significant links to the [[gospel of Luke]]. Major turning points in the structure of Acts, for example, find parallels in Luke: the presentation of the child Jesus in the Temple parallels the opening of Acts in the Temple, Jesus' forty days of testing in the wilderness prior to his mission parallel the forty days prior to his Ascension in Acts, the mission of Jesus in Samaria and the Decapolis (the lands of the Samaritans and Gentiles) parallels the missions of the Apostles in Samaria and the Gentile lands, and so on (see [[Gospel of Luke]]). These parallels continue through both books.{{sfn|Tremmel|2011|p=59}}

There are also differences between Luke and Acts, amounting at times to outright contradiction. For example, the gospel seems to place the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] on [[Easter Sunday]], immediately after the [[Resurrection of Christ|Resurrection]], while Acts 1 puts it forty days later.{{sfn|Zwiep|2010|p=39}} There are similar conflicts over the theology. While not seriously questioning the single authorship of Luke-Acts, these differences do suggest the need for caution in seeking too much consistency in books written in essence as popular literature.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=17-18}}

===Pauline epistles===
Acts agrees with Paul's letters on the major outline of Paul's career: as Saul he is converted and becomes Paul the Christian missionary and apostle, establishing new churches in Asia Minor and the Aegean and struggling to free Gentile Christians from the [[Jewish Law]]. There are also agreements on many incidents, such as Paul's escape from Damascus, where he is lowered down the walls in a basket. But details of these same incidents are frequently contradictory: for example, according to Paul it was a pagan king who was trying to arrest him in Damascus, but according to Luke it was, characteristically, the Jews (2 Corinthians 11:33 and Acts 9:24). Many of the disagreements are not so immediately obvious: Acts speaks of &quot;Christians&quot; and &quot;disciples&quot;, but Paul never uses either term, and there are striking differences in the accounts of Paul's relationship with the Jerusalem church and its leaders (Acts 9-15 vs. Galatians 1-2). Acts omits much from the letters, notably Paul's problems with his congregations (internal difficulties are said to be the fault of the Jews instead), and his apparent final rejection by the church leaders in Jerusalem (Acts has Paul and Barnabas deliver an offering that is accepted, a trip that has no mention in the letters). There are also major differences between Acts on Paul on [[Christology]] (the understanding of Christ's nature), eschatology (understanding of the &quot;last things&quot;), and [[twelve apostles|apostles]]hip.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=581, 588-590}}

'''Assyria''' was a major [[Mesopotamian]] [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] kingdom, and empire, of the [[Ancient Near East]], existing as an independent state for a period of approximately nineteen centuries from c. 2500 BC to 605 BC, spanning the [[Early Bronze Age]] through to the late [[Iron Age]]. For a further thirteen centuries, from the end of the 7th century BC to the mid-7th century AD, it survived as a [[geo-political]] entity, for the most part ruled by foreign powers, although a number of small [[Neo-Assyrian]] states such as [[Assur]], [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]] and [[Hatra]] arose at different times between the 1st century BC and late 3rd century AD.

Centered on the Upper [[Tigris river]], in [[northern Mesopotamia]] (modern northern [[Iraq]], northeastern [[Syria]] and southeastern [[Turkey]]) the Assyrians came to rule powerful empires at several times, the last of which grew to be the largest and most powerful empire the world had yet seen.

As a substantial part of the greater [[Mesopotamian]] &quot;[[cradle of civilization]]&quot; which included [[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] and much later [[Babylonia]], Assyria was at the height of technological, scientific and cultural achievements for its time. At its peak, the Assyrian empire stretched from [[Cyprus]] in the Mediterranean Sea to [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]), and from what is now [[Armenia]] to the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Egypt]].

Assyria is named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[Aššur]] (a.k.a. [[Ashur]]) which dates to c. 2600 BC (located in what is now the [[Saladin Province]] of northern [[Iraq]]), originally one of a number of [[Akkadian]] city states in Mesopotamia. In the 25th and 24th centuries BC, Assyrian kings were pastoral leaders, and from the late 24th century BC became subject to [[Sargon of Akkad]], who united all the [[Akkadian]] [[Semites]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]-speaking peoples of Mesopotamia under the [[Akkadian Empire]], which lasted from c. 2334 BC to 2154 BC. Following the fall of the Akkadian Empire c. 2154 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', pp. 161–191.&lt;/ref&gt; and the short lived succeeding [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] which ruled southern Assyria but not the north, Assyria regained full independence.

The history of Assyria proper is roughly divided into three periods, known as Old Assyrian, Middle Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian. These terms are in wide use in [[Assyrology]] and roughly correspond to the early to [[Middle Bronze Age]], [[Late Bronze Age]] and [[Early Iron Age]], respectively. In the Old Assyrian period, Assyria established colonies in [[Asia Minor]] and [[the Levant]] and, under king [[Ilushuma]], it asserted itself over southern Mesopotamia. From the mid 18th century BC, Assyria came into conflict with the newly created state of [[Babylonia]], which eventually eclipsed the far older Sumero-Akkadian states in the south, such as [[Ur]], [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]].

Assyria experienced fluctuating fortunes in the Old Assyrian period. Assyria became a regionally powerful nation with the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] from the late 21st century to the mid 18th century BC. Following this, it found itself under short periods of Babylonian and [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrian]] rule in the 18th and 15th centuries BC respectively, and another period of great power occurred with the rise of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (from 1365 BC to 1056 BC), which included the reigns of great kings, such as [[Ashur-uballit I]], [[Arik-den-ili]], [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. During this period, Assyria overthrew the [[Mitanni]]-Empire and eclipsed the [[Hittite Empire]], [[Egyptian Empire]], [[Babylonia]], [[Elam]] and [[Phrygia]] in the [[Near East]].

Beginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]] from 911 BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot;&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq''{{page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it again became a great power over the next three centuries, overthrowing the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt]] and conquering [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot;/&gt; Babylonia, [[Elam]], [[Urartu]], [[Armenians|Armenia]], [[Media (region)|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Mannaeans|Mannea]], [[Gutium]], [[Phoenicia]]/[[Canaan]], [[Aramea]] ([[Syria]]), [[Arabia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Edom]], [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], [[Samarra]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Chaldea]], [[Nabatea]], [[Commagene]], [[Dilmun]], [[Libya]], the [[Hurrians]], [[Sutu, Iran|Sutu]] and [[Neo-Hittites]], driving the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]], [[Kushites]] and [[Nubians]] from Egypt,&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot;/&gt; subjugating the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] and exacting tribute from [[Phrygia]], [[Majan (civilization)|Magan]] and [[Land of Punt|Punt]]{{clarify|date=April 2014}} among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot;/&gt;

After its fall (between 612 BC and 605 BC), Assyria remained a province and geo-political entity under the Babylonian, Median, [[Achaemenid]], [[Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Sassanid]] empires until the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] invasion and conquest of Mesopotamia in the mid-7th century AD, when it was finally dissolved, after which the remnants of the [[Assyrian people]] (by now almost exclusively [[East Syrian Rite|Eastern Rite]] [[Assyrian Christians]]) gradually became an ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious minority in the traditional [[Assyrian homeland]]s, surviving there to this day. (see [[Assyrian continuity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Parpola, Simo 2004&quot;&gt;Parpola, Simo (2004). &quot;National and Ethnic Identity in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Assyrian Identity in Post-Empire Times&quot; (PDF).

==Names==
Assyria was also sometimes known as [[Subartu]] and ''Azuhinum'' prior to the rise of the [[city state]] of [[Assur|Ashur]] after which it was 𒀸𒋗𒁺 𐎹 '''''Aššūrāyu''''', and after its fall, from 605 BC through to the late 7th century AD variously as [[Athura]] and also referenced as [[Atouria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Y Odisho|first=George|title=The sound system of modern Assyrian (Neo-Aramaic)|year=1998|publisher=Harrowitz|isbn=3-447-02744-4|page=8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ON7BEtQvejcC&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=strabo%20atouria&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q=strabo%20atouria&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to [[Strabo]], ''Syria'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]), ''Assyria'' ([[Latin]]) and [[Assuristan]]. After its dissolution in the mid 7th century AD it remained ''The Ecclesiastical Province of Ator''. The term ''Assyria'' can also refer to the geographic region or heartland where Assyria, its empires and the Assyrian people were (and still are) centered. The modern [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christian]] (AKA [[Chaldo-Assyrian]]) ethnic minority in northern [[Iraq]], north east [[Syria]], south east Turkey and north west [[Iran]] are the descendants of the ancient Assyrians (see [[Assyrian continuity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;H.W.F. Saggs&quot;&gt;Saggs notes that: &quot;the destruction of the Assyrian empire did not wipe out its population. They were predominantly peasant farmers and, since Assyria contains some of the best wheat land in the Near East, their descendants would, as opportunity permitted, build new villages over the old cities and carry on with agricultural life, remembering traditions of the former cities. After seven or eight centuries and various vicissitudes, these people became Christians&quot; (''[[The Might That Was Assyria]]'', p. 290).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |title=Parpola identity_article|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110717071922/http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf| archivedate= 17 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-history of Assyria==
In prehistoric times, the region that was to become known as Assyria (and Subartu) was home to a [[Neanderthal]] culture such as has been found at the [[Shanidar Cave]]. The earliest [[Neolithic]] sites in Assyria were the [[Jarmo]] culture c. 7100 BC and [[Hassuna|Tell Hassuna]], the centre of the ''Hassuna culture'', c. 6000 BC.

During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkad]]ians throughout [[Mesopotamia]], which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].&lt;ref name='Deutscher'&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20–21|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] (a [[language isolate]], i.e. not related to any other language) on [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.&lt;ref name='Deutscher'/&gt; This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.&lt;ref name='Deutscher'/&gt;
[[File:Letter Luenna Louvre AO4238.jpg|thumb|Letter sent by the high-priest Lu'enna to the king of [[Lagash]] (maybe [[Urukagina]]), informing him of his son's death in combat, c. 2400 BC, found in [[Girsu]].]]
Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere after the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot;&gt;Woods C. 2006 &quot;Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian&quot;. In S.L. Sanders (ed) ''Margins of Writing, Origins of Culture'': 91–120 Chicago [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

The cities of [[Assur]] (also spelled [[Ashur]] or [[Aššur]]) and [[Nineveh]], together with a number of other towns and cities, existed since at least before the middle of the 3rd millennium BC (c. 2600 BC), although they appear to have been Sumerian-ruled administrative centres at this time, rather than independent states.

According to some [[Judaeo-Christian]] writers {{who|date=September 2014}}, the city of Ashur was founded by [[Ashur (Bible)|Ashur]] the son of [[Shem]], who was deified by later generations as the city's patron god {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}. However, it is not among the cities said to have been founded by him in Genesis 10:11–12, and the far older Assyrian annals make no mention of the much later Judeo-Christian figures of Shem and Ashur.

Assyrian tradition lists an early Assyrian king named [[Ushpia]] as having dedicated the first temple to the god Ashur in the city in the 21st century BC. It is highly likely that the city was named in honour of its patron Assyrian god with the same name.

===Classical dating===
[[George Syncellus]] in his ''Chronographia'' quotes a fragment from [[Julius Africanus]] which dates the founding of Assyria to 2284 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cory's Ancient Fragments]], [[Isaac Preston Cory]], 1832, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman historian [[Velleius Paterculus]] citing Aemilius Sura states that Assyria was founded 1995 years before [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] was defeated in 197 BC (at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]]) by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;''Roman History'', Book 1, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The sum therefore 197 + 1995 = 2192 BC for the foundation of Assyria. [[Diodorus Siculus]] recorded another tradition from [[Ctesias]], that dates Assyria 1,306 years before 883 BC (the starting date of the reign of [[Ashurnasirpal II]]) and so the sum 883 + 1306 = 2189 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Antiquity'' by Maximilian Duncker, 1877, p.&amp;nbsp;26–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' of Eusebius provides yet another date for the founding of Assyria, with the accession of [[Ninus]], dating to 2057 BC, but the Armenian translation of the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' puts this figure back slightly to 2116 BC. Another classical dating tradition found in the ''[[Excerpta Latina Barbari]]'' dates the foundation of Assyria, under [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], to 2206 BC.

==Early Assyria, 2600–2335 BC==
The city of Ashur, together with a number of other Assyrian cities, seem to have been established by 2600 BC, however it is likely that they were initially Sumerian dominated administrative centres. In c. the late 26th century BC, [[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]], then the dominant [[Sumer]]ian ruler in Mesopotamia, mentions &quot;smiting [[Subartu]]&quot; (Subartu being the Sumerian name for Assyria). Similarly, in c. the early 25th century BC, [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]] the king of the Sumerian state of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] lists Subartu as paying tribute to him.

Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. In the [[Assyrian King List]], the earliest king recorded was [[Tudiya]]. In archaeological reports from [[Ebla]], it appeared that Tudiya's activities were confirmed with the discovery of a tablet where he concluded a treaty for the operation of a ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]'' (trading colony) in Eblaite territory, with &quot;king&quot; Ibrium of Ebla (who is now known to have been the [[vizier]] of Ebla for king [[Ishar-Damu]]). This entire reading is now questionable, as several scholars have more recently argued that the treaty in question may not have been with king Tudiya of Assyria, but rather with the unnamed king of an uncertain location called &quot;Abarsal&quot;.

Tudiya was succeeded on the list by [[Adamu]] and then a further thirteen rulers (Yangi, Shuhlamu, Harharu, Mandaru, Imshu, Harshu, Didanu, Hanu, Zuabu, Nuabu, Abazu, Belu and Azarah). Nothing concrete is yet known about these names, although it has been noted that a much later Babylonian tablet listing the ancestral lineage of [[Hammurabi]], the [[Amorite]] king of Babylon, seems to have copied the same names from Tudiya through Nuabu, though in a heavily corrupted form.

The earliest kings, such as Tudiya, who are recorded as ''kings who lived in tents'', were independent semi-nomadic pastoralist rulers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot;/&gt; These kings at some point became fully urbanised and founded the ''city state'' of [[Ashur]].&lt;ref&gt;Saggs, ''The Might'', 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assyria in the Akkadian Empire and Neo-Sumerian Empires==

During the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2334–2154 BC) the Assyrians, like all the Mesopotamian Semites (and also the Sumerians), became subject to the dynasty of the city state of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], centered in central Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire founded by [[Sargon the Great]], claimed to encompass the surrounding &quot;four quarters&quot;. The region of Assyria, north of the seat of the empire in central Mesopotamia had also been known as [[Subartu]] by the Sumerians, and the name [[Azuhinum]] in Akkadian records also seems to refer to Assyria proper.

Assyrian rulers were subject to Sargon and his successors, and the city of Ashur became a regional administrative center of the Empire, implicated by the [[Nuzi#Archaeology|Nuzi tablets]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shendge1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Malati J. Shendge|title=The language of the Harappans: from Akkadian to Sanskrit|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xb6CZMmwo00C&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-325-0|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the Akkadian-speaking Semites of Mesopotamia came to rule an empire encompassing not only Mesopotamia itself but large swathes of Asia Minor, ancient Iran, Elam, the [[Arabian Peninsula]], Canaan and Syria.

Assyria seems to have already been firmly involved in trade in Asia Minor by this time; the earliest known reference to Anatolian ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]''s in [[Hittite empire|Hatti]], was found on later cuneiform tablets describing the early period of the Akkadian Empire (c. 2350 BC). On those tablets, Assyrian traders in [[Burushanda]] implored the help of their ruler, Sargon the Great, and this appellation continued to exist throughout the Assyrian Empire for about 1,700 years. The name &quot;Hatti&quot; itself even appears in later accounts of his grandson, [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], campaigning in Anatolia.

Assyrian and Akkadian traders spread the use of writing in the form of the Mesopotamian [[cuneiform]] script to [[Asia Minor]] and [[The Levant]] (modern [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]).

However, towards the end of the reign of [[Sargon the Great]], the Assyrian faction rebelled against him; &quot;the tribes of Assyria of the upper country—in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote them grievously&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Malati J. Shendge (1 January 1997). The language of the Harappans: from Akkadian to Sanskrit. Abhinav Publications. p. 46. ISBN 978-81-7017-325-0. Retrieved 22 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akkadian Empire was destroyed by economic decline and internal civil war, followed by attacks from barbarian [[Gutian people]] in 2154 BC.

The rulers of Assyria during the period between c. 2154 BC and 2112 BC once again became fully independent, as the Gutians are only known to have administered southern Mesopotamia. However, the king list is the only information from Assyria for this period.

Most of Assyria briefly became part of the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] (or [[3rd dynasty of Ur]]) founded in c. 2112 BC. Sumerian domination extended as far as the city of Ashur, but appears not to have reached Nineveh and the far north of Assyria. One local ruler (''shakkanakku'') named [[Zāriqum]] (who does not appear on any Assyrian king list) is listed as paying tribute to [[Amar-Sin]] of Ur. Ashur's rulers appear to have remained largely under Sumerian domination until the mid-21st century BC (c. 2050 BC); the king list names Assyrian rulers for this period and several are known from other references to have also borne the title of ''shakkanakka'' or vassal governors for the neo-Sumerians.

==Old Assyrian Kingdom==
The first written inscriptions by 'urbanised' Assyrian kings appear in the mid-21st century BC, after they had shrugged off Sumerian domination. The land of Assyria as a whole then consisted of a number of city states and small Semitic kingdoms, some of which were initially independent of Assyria. The foundation of the first major temple in the city of Ashur was traditionally ascribed to king [[Ushpia]] who reigned c. 2050 BC, possibly a contemporary of [[Ishbi-Erra]] of [[Isin]] and [[Naplanum]] of [[Larsa]].&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[Assyrian King List]] and Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was reputedly succeeded by kings named [[Apiashal]], [[Sulili]], [[Kikkiya]] and [[Akiya]] (died c. 2026 BC), of whom little is known, apart from much later mentions of Kikkiya conducting fortifications on the city walls, and building work on temples in Ashur.

The main rivals, neighbours or trading partners to early Assyrian kings during the 22nd, 21st and 20th centuries BC would have been the [[Hattians]] and [[Hurrians]] to the north in Asia Minor, the [[Gutians]], [[Lullubi]] and [[Turukku]] to the east in the [[Zagros Mountains]] of northwest [[Ancient Iran]], the [[Elamites]] to the southeast in what is now south central Iran, the [[Amorites]] to the west in what is today Syria, and their fellow [[Sumero-Akkadian]] city-states of southern Mesopotamia such as [[Isin]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Ur]], [[Eshnunna]] and [[Larsa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot;/&gt;

Like many city-states in early Mesopotamian history, Ashur was, to a great extent, originally an [[oligarchy]] rather than a monarchy. Authority was considered to lie with &quot;the City&quot;, and the polity had three main centres of power—an assembly of elders, a hereditary ruler, and an [[eponym]]. The ruler presided over the assembly and carried out its decisions. He was not referred to with the usual Akkadian term for &quot;king&quot;, ''šarrum''/''Sharru''; that was instead reserved for the city's patron deity [[Assur (god)|Assur]], of whom the ruler was the high priest. The ruler himself was only designated as &quot;the steward of Assur&quot; (''iššiak Assur''), where the term for steward is a borrowing from Sumerian ''[[ENSI|ensi(k)]]''. The third centre of power was the eponym (''limmum''), who gave the year his name, similarly to the later [[archons of Athens|archons]] and [[Roman consul|consuls]] of [[Classical Antiquity]]. He was annually elected by [[Sortition|lot]] and was responsible for the economic administration of the city, which included the power to detain people and confiscate property. The institution of the eponym as well as the formula ''iššiak Assur'' lingered on as ceremonial vestiges of this early system throughout the history of the Assyrian monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Mogens Trolle (2000): &quot;The old Assyrian city-state&quot;. In Hansen, Mogens Herman, ''A comparative study of thirty city-state cultures: an investigation / conducted by the Copenhagen Polis Centre'', p.&amp;nbsp;77–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Refers to entire paragraph on political structure--&gt;

===Dynasty of Puzur-Ashur I, 2025–1809 BC, Old Assyrian Empire===
In approximately 2025 BC (long chronology), [[Puzur-Ashur I]] (perhaps a contemporary of [[Shu-ilishu]] of Larsa and [[Samium]] of Isin) is speculated to have overthrown Kikkiya and founded a new dynasty which was to survive for 216 years. His descendants left inscriptions mentioning him regarding the building of temples to gods such as Ashur, [[Adad]] and [[Ishtar]] in Assyria. The length of his reign is unknown.

[[Shalim-ahum]] (died c. 2009 BC) succeeded the throne at a currently unknown date. He left inscriptions in archaic Old Assyrian regarding the construction of a temple dedicated to the god Ashur, and the placement of [[beer vats]] within it.

[[Ilushuma]]&lt;ref&gt;Lines 27 to 28&lt;!-- OF WHAT?--&gt;: [IE-r]i-šu dumu Iilu-šum-ma [šá li-ma-ni]-šu-ni 40 mumeš lugalta dùuš.&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 2008–1975 BC) took the throne in c. 2008 BC, and is known from his inscription (extant in several copies) where he claims to have &quot;washed the copper&quot; and &quot;established liberty&quot; for the Akkadians in Sumerian city-states as far as the Persian Gulf. This has been taken by some scholars to imply that he made military campaigns into Southern Mesopotamia to relieve his fellow Mesopotamians from Amorite and Elamite invasions, however some recent scholars have taken the view that the inscription means he supplied these areas with copper from [[Hittite empire|Hatti]], and that the word used for &quot;liberty&quot; (''adduraru'') is usually in the context of his exempting the southern Mesopotamian kings from tariffs.

&quot;The freedom&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Freedom: ''addurāru''.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Akkadians and their children I established. I purified their copper. I established their freedom from the border of the marshes and Ur and Nippur, [[Awal]], and Kish, [[Der (Sumer)|Der]] of the goddess Ishtar, as far as the City of (Ashur).&quot;&lt;ref name=grayson&gt;{{ cite book | title = Assyrian Royal Inscriptions, Volume 1 | author = A. K. Grayson | publisher = Otto Harrassowitz | year = 1972 | pages = 7–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyria had long held extensive contact with Hattian, Hittite and Hurrian cities on the Anatolian plateau in Asia Minor. The Assyrians who had for centuries traded in the region, and possibly ruled small areas bordering Assyria, now established significant colonies in [[Cappadocia]] (e.g., at [[Kanesh]] (modern [[Kültepe]]) from 2008 BC to 1740 BC). These colonies, called ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]'', from the Akkadian word for 'port', were attached to Hattian cities in Anatolia, but physically separate, and had special tax status. They must have arisen from a long tradition of trade between Assyria and the Anatolian cities, but no archaeological or written records show this. The trade consisted of metals (copper or tin and perhaps iron; the terminology is not entirely clear) being traded for textiles from Assyria.

[[Erishum I]]&lt;ref&gt;Tablet copies: An 201139 and An 20114&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 1974–1935 BC) vigorously expanded Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor during his long reign, the major ones appearing to be at Kanesh, [[Ḫattuša]] ([[Boğazköy]]) (the future capital of the [[Hittite Empire]]) and [[Amkuwa]] ([[Alisar Höyük]]), together with a further eighteen smaller colonies. He created some of the earliest examples of [[Written Law]], conducted extensive building work in the form of fortifying the walls of major Assyrian cities and the erection of temples dedicated to Ashur and Ishtar. It is from his reign that the continuous ''limmum'' lists are known, however there are references to the eponym-books for his predecessors having been destroyed at some point.

[[Ikunum]] (c. 1934–1921 BC)&lt;ref&gt;Cahit Günbattı, An Eponym List (KEL G) from Kültepe Altoriental. Forsch. 35 (2008) 1, 103–132.&lt;/ref&gt; built a major temple for the god [[Ningal]]. He further strengthened the fortifications of the city of Assur and maintained Assyria's colonies in Asia Minor.

It is likely he was named after his illustrious predecessor [[Sargon of Akkad]]. He is known to have refortified the defences of major Assyrian cities, and maintained Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor during his reign. Apart from this, little has yet been unearthed about him. At some point he appears to have withdrawn Assyrian aid to southern Mesopotamia. It was during his reign in Assyria that the initially minor city-state of [[Babylon]] was founded in 1894 BC by an [[Amorite]] ''Malka'' (prince) named [[Sumuabum]].

[[Puzur-Ashur II]] (c. 1881–1873 BC) came to the throne as an already older man due to his fathers long reign. Little is known about his rule, but it appears to have been uneventful.

[[Naram-Sin of Assyria|Naram-Suen]] (c. 1872–1818 BC) ascended to the throne in 1872 BC, and is likely named after his predecessor [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] of the Akkadian Empire. Assyria continued to be wealthy during his 54-year-long reign (one of the longest in the ancient Near East), and he defeated the future usurper king [[Shamshi-Adad I]] who attempted to take his throne.

[[Erishum II]] (c. 1818–1809 BC) was to be the last king of the dynasty of Puzur-Ashur I, founded c. 2025 BC. After only eight or nine years in power he was overthrown by Shamshi-Adad I, the Amorite usurper who had previously been defeated in an attempt to unseat [[Naram-Sin of Assyria|Naram-Suen]], and who claimed legitimacy by asserting descent from the mid 21st century BC Assyrian king, [[Ushpia]].

===Amorite Period in Assyria, 1809–1750 BC===
The Amorites were successfully repelled by the Assyrian kings of the 20th and 19th centuries BC.
However, in 1809 BC the native Mesopotamian king of Assyria [[Erishum II]] was deposed, and the throne of Assyria was usurped by [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (c. 1809 – 1776 BC) in the expansion of Semitic [[Amorite]] tribes from the [[Khabur River]] delta in the north eastern Levant.

Although regarded as an Amorite by later Assyrian tradition, Shamshi-Adad's descent is suggested to be from the same line as the native Mesopotamian ruler Ushpia in the [[Assyrian King List]]. He put his son [[Ishme-Dagan]] on the throne of a nearby Assyrian city, [[Ekallatum]], and maintained Assyria's Anatolian colonies. Shamshi-Adad I then went on to conquer the kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] (in modern Syria) on the [[Euphrates]] putting another of his sons, [[Yasmah-Adad]] on the throne there. Shamshi-Adad's Assyria now encompassed the whole of northern Mesopotamia and included territory in central Mesopotamia, Asia Minor and northern Syria. Shamshi-Adad I mentions conducting raids on the [[Canaan]]ite coasts of the far off [[Mediterranean]], where he erected stelae to commemorate his victories. He himself resided in a new capital city founded in the Khabur valley in northern Mesopotamia, called [[Shubat-Enlil]].

[[Ishme-Dagan I]] (1774–1763 BC) inherited Assyria, but Yasmah-Adad was overthrown by a new king called [[Zimrilim]] in Mari. The new king of Mari allied himself with the [[Amorite]] king [[Hammurabi]] of [[Babylon]], who had made the recently created, and originally minor state of Babylon into a major power. It was from the reign of Hammurabi onwards that southern Mesopotamia came to be known as [[Babylonia]].

Assyria now faced the rising power of Babylon in the south. Ishme-Dagan responded by making an alliance with the enemies of Babylon, and the power struggle continued without resolution for decades. Ishme-Dagan, like his father was a great warrior, and in addition to repelling Babylonian attacks, campaigned successfully against the [[Turukku]] and [[Lullubi]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] (in modern Iran) who had attacked the Assyrian city of [[Ekallatum]], and against [[Dadusha]], king of [[Eshnunna]], and the state of [[Iamhad]] (modern [[Aleppo]]).

===Assyria under Babylonian domination, 1750–1732 BC===
Hammurabi, after first conquering Mari, Larsa, and [[Eshnunna]], eventually prevailed over Ishme-Dagan's successor [[Mut-Ashkur]] (1750–1740 BC), and subjected him to Babylon c. 1750 BC. With Hammurabi, the various ''karum'' colonies in Anatolia ceased trade activity—probably because the goods of Assyria were now being traded with the Babylonians. The Assyrian monarchy survived, however the three Amorite kings succeeding Ishme-Dagan, [[Mut-Ashkur]] (who was the son of Ishme-Dagan and married to a Hurrian queen), [[Rimush]] (1739–1733 BC) and [[Asinum]] (1732 BC), were vassals, dependent on the Babylonians during the reign of Hammurabi, and for a short time, of his successor [[Samsu-iluna]].

===Assyrian Adaside dynasty, 1732–1451 BC===
The short lived [[Babylonian Empire]] quickly began to unravel upon the death of Hammurabi, and Babylonia lost control over Assyria during the reign of Hammurabi's successor [[Samsu-iluna]] (1750–1712 BC). A period of civil war ensued after Asinum (a grandson of Shamshi-Adad I and the last Amorite ruler of Assyria) was deposed in approximately 1732 BC by a powerful native Assyrian vice regent named [[Puzur-Sin]], who regarded Asinum as both a foreigner and a former lackey of Babylon.

A native king named [[Ashur-dugul]] seized the throne in 1732 BC, probably with the help of Puzur-Sin. However, he was unable to retain control for long, and was soon deposed by a rival claimant, [[Ashur-apla-idi]]. Internal instability ensued with four further kings ([[Nasir-Sin]], [[Sin-namir]], [[Ipqi-Ishtar]] and [[Adad-salulu]]) all reigning in quick succession over a period of approximately six years between 1732 and 1727 BC. Babylonia seems to have been too powerless to intervene or take advantage of this situation.

Finally, a king named [[Adasi]] (1726–1701 BC) came to the fore c. 1726 BC and managed to quell the civil unrest and stabilise the situation in Assyria. Adasi completely drove the Babylonians and Amorites from the Assyrian sphere of influence during his reign, and Babylonian power began to quickly wane in Mesopotamia as a whole, also losing the far south of Mesopotamia (an area roughly corresponding to ancient [[Sumer]]) to the native Akkadian-speaking [[Sealand Dynasty]], although the Amorites would retain control over a much reduced and weak Babylonia itself until 1595 BC, when they were overthrown by the [[Kassites]], a people from the [[Zagros]] Mountains who spoke a [[language isolate]] and were neither Semites nor Indo-Europeans.
[[File:Dräkt, Assyrier, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|130px|Assyrian, 1400 BC]]

Adasi was succeeded by [[Bel-bani]] (1700–1691 BC) who is credited in Assyrian annals with inflicting further defeats on the Babylonians and Amorites, and further strengthening and stabilising the kingdom.

Little is currently known of many of the kings that followed such as; [[Libaya]] (1690–1674 BC), [[Sharma-Adad I]] (1673–1662 BC), [[Iptar-Sin]] (1661–1650 BC), [[Bazaya]] (1649–1622 BC) (a contemporary of [[Peshgaldaramesh]] of the [[Sealand Dynasty]]), [[Lullaya]] (1621–1618 BC) (who usurperped the throne from Bazaya), [[Shu-Ninua]] (1615–1602 BC) and [[Sharma-Adad II]] (1601–1599 BC). However, Assyria seems to have been a relatively strong and stable nation, existing undisturbed by its neighbours such as the Hatti, Hittites, Hurrians, Amorites, Babylonians, Elamites or Mitanni during this period.

Assyria remained strong and secure; when Babylon was sacked and its Amorite rulers deposed by the [[Hittite Empire]], and subsequently fell to the [[Kassites]] in 1595 BC, both powers were unable to make any inroads into Assyria, and there seems to have been no trouble between the first Kassite ruler of Babylon, [[Agum II]], and [[Erishum III]] (1598–1586 BC) of Assyria, and a mutually beneficial treaty was signed between the two rulers.

[[Shamshi-Adad II]] (1585–1580 BC), [[Ishme-Dagan II]] (1579–1562 BC) and [[Shamshi-Adad III]] (1562–1548 BC) seem also to have had peaceful tenures, although few records have thus far been discovered about their reigns. Similarly, [[Ashur-nirari I]] (1547–1522 BC) seems not to have been troubled by the newly founded Mitanni Empire in Asia Minor, the Hittite empire, or Babylon during his 25-year reign. He is known to have been an active king, improving the infrastructure, dedicating temples and conducting various building projects throughout the kingdom.

[[Puzur-Ashur III]] (1521–1498 BC) proved to be a strong and energetic ruler. He undertook much rebuilding work in Assur, the city was refortified and the southern quarters incorporated into the main city defences. Temples to the moon god [[Sin]] ([[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]) and the sun god [[Shamash]] were erected during his reign. He signed a treaty with [[Burnaburiash I|Burna-Buriash I]] the Kassite king of Babylon, defining the borders of the two nations in the late 16th century BC. He was succeeded by [[Enlil-nasir I]] (1497–1483 BC) who appears to have had a peaceful an uneventful reign, as does his successor [[Nur-ili]] (1482–1471 BC).

The son of Nur-ili, [[Ashur-shaduni]] (1470 BC) was deposed by his uncle [[Ashur-rabi I]] (1470–1451 BC) in his first year of rule. Little is known about his nineteen-year reign, but it appears to have been largely uneventful.

===Assyria in decline, 1450–1393 BC===
The emergence of the Mitanni Empire in the 16th century BC did eventually lead to a short period of sporadic Mitanni-Hurrian domination in the latter half of the 15th century. The Indo-European-speaking Mitanni are thought to have conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous Hurrians of eastern Anatolia. The Hurrians spoke a [[language isolate]], i.e. neither Semitic nor Indo-European.

[[Ashur-nadin-ahhe I]] (1450–1431 BC) was courted by the [[Egypt]]ians, who were rivals of the Mitanni, and attempting to gain a foothold in the [[Near East]]. [[Amenhotep II]] sent the Assyrian king a tribute of gold to seal an alliance against the Hurri-Mitanni empire. It is likely that this alliance prompted [[Saushtatar]], the Mitanni emperor, to invade Assyria, and sack the city of Ashur, after which Assyria became a sometime vassal state, with Ashur-nadin-ahhe I being forced to pay tribute to Saushtatar. He was deposed by his own brother [[Enlil-nasir II]] (1430–1425 BC) in 1430 BC, possibly with the aid of the Mitanni, who received tribute from the new king. [[Ashur-nirari II]] (1424–1418 BC) had an uneventful reign, and appears to have also paid tribute to the Mitanni Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot; /&gt;

The Assyrian monarchy survived, and the Mitanni influence appears to have been sporadic. They appear not to have been always willing or indeed able to interfere in Assyrian internal and international affairs.

[[Ashur-bel-nisheshu]] (1417–1409 BC) seems to have been independent of Mitanni influence, as evidenced by his signing a mutually beneficial treaty with [[Karaindash]], the Kassite king of Babylonia in the late 15th century. He also undertook extensive rebuilding work in Ashur itself, and Assyria appears to have redeveloped its former highly sophisticated financial and economic systems during his reign.

[[Ashur-rim-nisheshu]] (1408–1401 BC) also undertook building work, strengthening the city walls of the capital.

[[Ashur-nadin-ahhe II]] (1400–1393 BC) also received a tribute of gold and diplomatic overtures from Egypt, probably in an attempt to gain Assyrian military support against Egypt's Mitanni and Hittite rivals in the region. However, the Assyrian king appears not to have been in a strong enough position to challenge the Mitanni or Hittites.

[[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392–1366 BC), a son of Ashur-bel-nisheshu, ascended the throne in 1392 BC and finally broke the ties to the Mitanni Empire.

There are dozens of Mesopotamian cuneiform texts from this period, with precise observations of solar and lunar eclipses, that have been used as 'anchors' in the various attempts to define the [[chronology of Babylonia and Assyria]] for the early 2nd millennium BC (i.e., the &quot;high&quot;, &quot;middle&quot;, and &quot;low&quot; chronologies.)

Scholars variously date the beginning of the &quot;Middle Assyrian period&quot; to either the fall of the Old Assyrian kingdom of [[Shamshi-Adad I]], or to the ascension of [[Ashur-uballit I]] to the throne of Assyria.

===Assyrian expansion and empire, 1392–1056 BC===
{{See also|Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire}}
By the reign of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392–1366 BC) Mitanni influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between [[Tushratta]] and his brother [[Artatama II]] and after this his son [[Shuttarna II]], who called himself king of the Hurri while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus finally broken Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs.

[[Ashur-uballit I]] (1365–1330 BC) succeeded the throne of Assyria in 1365 BC, and proved to be a fierce, ambitious and powerful ruler. Assyrian pressure from the southeast and Hittite pressure from the north-west, enabled Ashur-uballit I to break Mitanni power. He met and decisively defeated Shuttarna II, the Mitanni king in battle, making Assyria once more an imperial power at the expense of not only the Mitanni themselves, but also Kassite Babylonia, the Hurrians and the Hittites; and a time came when the Kassite king in Babylon was glad to marry [[Muballiṭat-Šērūa]], the daughter of Ashur-uballit, whose letters to [[Akhenaten]] of Egypt form part of the [[Amarna letters]].

This marriage led to disastrous results for Babylonia, as the Kassite faction at court murdered the half Assyrian Babylonian king and placed a pretender on the throne. Assur-uballit I promptly invaded Babylonia to avenge his son-in-law, entering Babylon, deposing the king and installing [[Kurigalzu II]] of the royal line king there.

Ashur-uballit I then attacked and defeated [[Shattiwaza|Mattiwaza]], the Mitanni king, despite attempts by the Hittite king [[Suppiluliumas]], now fearful of growing Assyrian power, to help the Mitanni. The lands of the Mitanni and Hurrians were duly appropriated by Assyria, making it a large and powerful empire.

[[Enlil-nirari]] (1329–1308 BC) succeeded Ashur-uballit I. He described himself as a &quot;Great-King&quot; (''Sharru rabû'') in letters to the Hittite kings. He was immediately attacked by Kurigalzu II of Babylon who had been installed by his father, but succeeded in defeating him, repelling Babylonian attempts to invade Assyria, counterattacking and appropriating Babylonian territory in the process, thus further expanding Assyria.

The successor of Enlil-nirari, [[Arik-den-ili]] (c. 1307–1296 BC), consolidated Assyrian power, and successfully campaigned in the [[Zagros]] Mountains to the east, subjugating the Lullubi and Gutians. In Syria, he defeated Semitic tribes of the so-called [[Ahlamu]] group, who were possibly predecessors of the Arameans or an Aramean tribe.

He was followed by [[Adad-nirari I]] (1295–1275 BC) who made [[Kalhu]] (Biblical [[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]) his capital, and continued expansion to the northwest, mainly at the expense of the Hittites and Hurrians, conquering Hittite territories such as [[Carchemish]] and beyond. He then moved into north eastern Asia Minor, conquering [[Shupria]].  Adad-nirari I made further gains to the south, annexing Babylonian territory and forcing the Kassite rulers of Babylon into accepting a new frontier agreement in Assyria's favour.

Adad-nirari's inscriptions are more detailed than any of his predecessors. He declares that the gods of Mesopotamia called him to war, a statement used by most subsequent Assyrian kings. He referred to himself again as ''Sharru Rabi'' (meaning &quot;The Great King&quot; in the Akkadian language) and conducted extensive building projects in Ashur and the provinces.

In 1274 BC [[Shalmaneser I]] (1274–1244 BC) ascended the throne. He proved to be a great warrior king. During his reign he conquered the Hurrian kingdom of [[Urartu]] that would have encompassed most of Eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus Mountains in the 9th century BC, and the fierce Gutians of the Zagros. He then attacked the Mitanni-Hurrians, defeating both King [[Shattuara]] and his Hittite and Aramaean allies, finally completely destroying the Hurri-Mitanni kingdom in the process.

During the campaign against the Hittites, Shattuara cut off the Assyrian army from their supply of food and water, but the Assyrians broke free in a desperate battle, counterattacked, and conquered and annexed what remained of the Mitanni kingdom. Shalmaneser I installed an Assyrian prince, [[Ilu-ippada]] as ruler of Mitanni, with Assyrian governors such as [[Meli-sah]], installed to rule individual cities.

The Hittites, having failed to save Mitanni, allied with Babylon in an unsuccessful economic war against Assyria for many years. Assyria was now a large and powerful empire, and a major threat to Egyptian and Hittite interests in the region, and was perhaps the reason that these two powers, fearful of Assyrian might, made peace with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father, Shalmaneser was a great builder and he further expanded the city of Kalhu at the juncture of the Tigris and Zab Rivers.

Shalmaneser's son and successor, [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1244–1207 BC), won a major victory against the Hittites and their king [[Tudhaliya IV]] at the [[Battle of Nihriya]] and took thousands of prisoners. He then conquered Babylonia, taking [[Kashtiliash IV]] as a captive and ruled there himself as king for seven years, taking on the old title &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot; first used by Sargon of Akkad. Tukulti-Ninurta I thus became the first Akkadian speaking native Mesopotamian to rule the state of Babylonia, its founders having been foreign Amorites, succeeded by equally foreign Kassites. Tukulti-Ninurta petitioned the god [[Shamash]] before beginning his counter offensive.&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;{{cite book | title = Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 2, Part 2, History of the Middle East and the Aegean Region, c. 1380–1000 BC | chapter = Assyrian Military Power, 1300–1200 B.C. | author = J.

In the process he defeated the Elamites, who had themselves coveted Babylon. He also wrote an epic poem documenting his wars against Babylon and Elam. After a Babylonian revolt, he raided and plundered the temples in Babylon, regarded as an act of sacrilege. As relations with the priesthood in Ashur began deteriorating, Tukulti-Ninurta built a new capital city; [[Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', pp. 26–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of historians, including [[Julian Jaynes]], identify [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] and his deeds as the historical origin for the fictional biblical character [[Nimrod]] in the Old Testament.

However, Tukulti-Ninurta's sons rebelled and besieged the ageing king in his capital. He was murdered and then succeeded by [[Ashur-nadin-apli]] (1206–1203 BC) who left the running of his empire to Assyrian regional governors such as [[Adad-bēl-gabbe]]. Another unstable period for Assyria followed, it was riven by periods of internal strife and the new king only made token and unsuccessful attempts to recapture Babylon, whose Kassite kings had taken advantage of the upheavals in Assyria and freed themselves from Assyrian rule. However, Assyria itself was not threatened by foreign powers during the reigns of [[Ashur-nirari III]] (1202–1197 BC), [[Enlil-kudurri-usur]] (1196–1193 BC) and [[Ninurta-apal-Ekur]] (1192–1180 BC), although Ninurta-apal-Ekur usurped the throne from Enlil-kudurri-usur.

[[Ashur-Dan I]] (1179–1133 BC) stabilised the internal unrest in Assyria during his unusually long reign, quelling instability. During the twilight years of the Kassite dynasty in Babylonia, he &lt;ref&gt;''Synchronistic History'', ii 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; records that he seized northern Babylonia, including the cities of [[Zaban]], [[Irriya]] and [[Ugar-sallu]] during the reigns of [[Marduk-apla-iddina I]] and [[Zababa-shuma-iddin]], plundering them and &quot;taking their vast booty to Assyria.&quot; However, the conquest of northern Babylonia brought Assyria into direct conflict with Elam which had taken the remainder of Babylonia. The powerful Elamites, under king [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]], fresh from sacking Babylon, entered into a protracted war with Assyria, they briefly took the Assyrian city of [[Arrapkha]], which Ashur-Dan I then retook, eventually defeating the Elamites and forcing a treaty upon them in the process.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=kertai/&gt;--&gt;

Another very brief period of internal upheaval followed the death of Ashur-Dan I when his son and successor [[Ninurta-tukulti-Ashur]] (1133 BC) was deposed in his first year of rule by his own brother [[Mutakkil-Nusku]] and forced to flee to Babylonia. [[Mutakkil-Nusku]] himself died in the same year (1133 BC).

A third brother, [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] (1133–1116 BC) took the throne. This was to lead to a renewed period of Assyrian expansion and empire. As the Hittite empire collapsed from the onslaught of the Indo-European [[Phrygians]] (called [[Mushki]] in Assyrian annals), Babylon and Assyria began to vie for Aramaean regions (in modern Syria), formerly under firm Hittite control. When their forces encountered one another in this region, the Assyrian king [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] met and defeated [[Nebuchadnezzar I]] of Babylon on a number of occasions. Assyria then invaded and annexed Hittite-controlled lands in Asia Minor, Aram (Syria), and Gutians and Kassite regions in the Zagros, marking an upsurge in imperian expansion.

[[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (1115–1077 BC), vies with [[Shamshi-Adad I]] and [[Ashur-uballit I]] among historians as being regarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. The son of Ashur-resh-ishi I, he ascended to the throne upon his father's death, and became one of the greatest of Assyrian conquerors during his 38-year reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot;&gt;The encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 26, Edited by Hugh Chrisholm, 1911, p. 968&lt;/ref&gt;

His first campaign in 1112 BC was against the Phrygians who had attempted to occupy certain Assyrian districts in the Upper Euphrates region of Asia Minor; after defeating and driving out the Phrygians he then overran the [[Luwian]] kingdoms of [[Commagene]], Cilicia and Cappadocia in western Asia Minor, and drove the Neo-Hittites from the Assyrian province of Subartu, northeast of [[Malatia]].

In a subsequent campaign, the Assyrian forces penetrated Urartu, into the mountains south of [[Lake Van]] and then turned westward to receive the submission of Malatia. In his fifth year, Tiglath-Pileser again attacked Commagene, Cilicia and Cappadocia, and placed a record of his victories engraved on copper plates in a fortress he built to secure his Anatolian conquests.

The Aramaeans of northern and central Syria were the next targets of the Assyrian king, who made his way as far as the sources of the Tigris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot;/&gt; The control of the high road to the Mediterranean was secured by the possession of the Hittite town of [[Pitru]]&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Trevor. The Routledge Handbook of The People and Places of Ancient Western Asia: The Near East from the Early Bronze Age to the fall of the Persians Empire, p.563&lt;/ref&gt; at the junction between the Euphrates and [[Sajur]]; thence he proceeded to conquer the Canaanite/Phoenician city-states of [[Byblos]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Simyra]], [[Berytus]] ([[Beirut]]), [[Aradus]] and finally [[Arvad]] where he embarked onto a ship to sail the [[Mediterranean]], on which he killed a ''nahiru'' or &quot;sea-horse&quot; (which [[A. Leo Oppenheim]] translates as a [[narwhal]]) in the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot;/&gt; He was passionately fond of hunting and was also a great builder. The general view is that the restoration of the temple of the gods [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] and [[Hadad]] at the Assyrian capital of Assur (Ashur) was one of his initiatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot;/&gt;
He also invaded and defeated Babylon twice, assuming the old title &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot;, forcing tribute from Babylon, although he did not actually depose the actual king in Babylonia, where the old ''Kassite Dynasty'' had now succumbed to an Elamite one.

He was succeeded by [[Asharid-apal-Ekur]] (1076–1074 BC) who reigned for just two years. His reign marked the elevation of the office of ''ummânu'' (royal scribe) in importance.

[[Ashur-bel-kala]] (1073–1056 BC) kept the vast empire together, campaigning successfully against Urartu and Phrygia to the north and the Arameans to the west. He maintained friendly relations with [[Marduk-shapik-zeri]] of Babylon, however upon the death of that king, he invaded Babylonia and deposed the new ruler [[Kadašman-Buriaš]], appointing [[Adad-apla-iddina]] as his vassal in Babylon. He built some of the earliest examples of both [[Zoological Gardens]] and [[Botanical Gardens]] in Ashur, collecting all manner of animals and plants from his empire, and receiving a collection of exotic animals as tributes from Egypt.

He was also a great hunter, describing his exploits &quot;at the city of [[Araziqu]] which is before the land of Hatti and at the foot of [[Mount Lebanon]].&quot; These locations show that well into his reign Assyria still controlled a vast empire.

Late in his reign, the Middle Assyrian Empire erupted into civil war, when a rebellion was orchestrated by [[Tukulti-Mer]], a pretender to the throne of Assyria. Ashur-bel-kala eventually crushed Tukulti-Mer and his allies, however the civil war in Assyria had allowed hordes of Arameans to take advantage of the situation, and press in on Assyrian controlled territory from the west. Ashur-bel-kala counterattacked them, and conquered as far as Carchemish and the source of the [[Khabur river]], but by the end of his reign many of the areas of Syria and Phoenicia-Canaan to the west of these regions as far as the Mediterranean, previously under firm Assyrian control, were eventually lost to the Assyrian Empire.

===Assyria during the Bronze Age Collapse, 1055–936 BC===
The [[Bronze Age Collapse]] from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a [[dark age (disambiguation)|dark age]] for the entire [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Caucasus]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan]] regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people.

Assyria and its empire were not unduly affected by these tumultuous events for some 150 years, perhaps the only ancient power that was not. However, upon the death of [[Ashur-bel-kala]] in 1056 BC, Assyria went into a ''comparative'' decline for the next 100 or so years. The empire shrank significantly, and by 1020 BC Assyria appears to have controlled only areas close to Assyria itself, essential to keeping trade routes open in eastern Aramea, south eastern Asia Minor central Mesopotamia and north western Iran.

New [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] peoples such as the Arameans, [[Chaldea]]ns and [[Suteans]] moved into areas to the west and south of Assyria, including overrunning much of Babylonia to the south, Indo-European speaking [[Iranic]] peoples such as the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Parthians]] moved into the lands to the east of Assyria, displacing the native Gutians and pressuring Elam and [[Mannea]] (which were all ancient non Indo-European civilisations of Iran), and to the north the Phrygians overran the Hittites, a new Hurrian state named Urartu arose in the Caucasus, and Cimmerians, [[Colchians]] (Georgians) and Scythians around the Black Sea and Caucasus. Egypt was divided and in disarray, and Israelites were battling with other fellow Semitic Canaanite peoples such as the [[Amalekites]], [[Moabites]], [[Edomites]] and [[Ammonites]] and the non-Semitic [[Peleset]]/[[Philistines]] (who have been conjectured to be one of the so-called [[Sea Peoples]])&lt;ref name=AK2013&gt;{{citation|title=The Philistines and Other “Sea Peoples” in Text and Archaeology|work=Society of Biblical Literature Archaeology and biblical studies|volume=15|first=Ann E.|last=Killebrew|publisher=Society of Biblical Lit|date=2013|isbn=9781589837218|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gBCl2IQfNioC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=2}}. Quote: &quot;First coined in 1881 by the French Egyptologist G. Maspero (1896), the somewhat misleading term &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; encompasses the ethnonyms Lukka, Sherden, Shekelesh, Teresh, Eqwesh, Denyen, Sikil / Tjekker, Weshesh, and Peleset (Philistines). [Footnote: The modern term &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; refers to peoples that appear in several New Kingdom Egyptian texts as originating from &quot;islands&quot; (tables 1-2; Adams and Cohen, this volume; see, e.g., Drews 1993, 57 for a summary). The use of quotation marks in association with the term &quot;Sea Peoples&quot; in our title is intended to draw attention to the problematic nature of this commonly used term. It is noteworthy that the designation &quot;of the sea&quot; appears only in relation to the Sherden, Shekelesh, and Eqwesh. Subsequently, this term was applied somewhat indiscriminately to several additional ethnonyms, including the Philistines, who are portrayed in their earliest appearance as invaders from the north during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses Ill (see, e.g., Sandars 1978; Redford 1992, 243, n. 14; for a recent review of the primary and secondary literature, see Woudhuizen 2006). Hencefore the term Sea Peoples will appear without quotation marks.]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drews48&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48 The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe Ca. 1200 B.C., Robert Drews, p48–61] Quote: &quot;The thesis that a great &quot;migration of the Sea Peoples&quot; occurred ca. 1200 B.C. is supposedly based on Egyptian inscriptions, one from the reign of Merneptah and another from the reign of Ramesses III. Yet in the inscriptions themselves such a migration nowhere appears. After reviewing what the Egyptian texts have to say about 'the sea peoples', one Egyptologist (Wolfgang Helck) recently remarked that although some things are unclear, &quot;eins ist aber sicher: Nach den agyptischen Texten haben wir es nicht mit einer 'Volkerwanderung' zu tun.&quot; Thus the migration hypothesis is based not on the inscriptions themselves but on their interpretation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; for the control of southern Canaan.

Despite the apparent weakness of Assyria in comparison to its former might, at heart it in fact remained a solid, well defended nation whose warriors were the best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt; Assyria, with its stable monarchy, powerful army and secure borders was in a stronger position during this time than potential rivals such as Egypt, Babylonia, Elam, Phrygia, Urartu, Persia and Media&lt;ref&gt;According to Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', pp.&amp;nbsp;282–283.&lt;/ref&gt; Kings such as [[Ashur-bel-kala]], [[Eriba-Adad II]], [[Ashur-rabi II]], [[Ashurnasirpal I]], [[Tiglath-Pileser II]] and [[Ashur-Dan II]] successfully defended Assyria's borders and upheld stability during this tumultuous time.

Assyrian kings during this period appear to have adopted a policy of maintaining and defending a compact, secure nation and satellite colonies immediately surrounding it, and interspersed this with sporadic punitive raids and invasions of neighbouring territories when the need arose.

[[Eriba-Adad II]] ruled for only two years, and in that time continued to campaign against the Arameans and neo-Hittites before he was deposed by his elderly uncle [[Shamshi-Adad IV]] (1053–1050 BC) who appears to have had an uneventful reign. [[Ashurnasirpal I]] (1049–1031 BC) succeeded him, and during his reign he continued to campaign endlessly against the Arameans to the west. Assyria was also afflicted by famine during this period. [[Shalmaneser II]] (1030–1019 BC) appears to have lost territory in the Levant to the Arameans, who also appear to have also occupied [[Nairi]] in southeast Asia Minor, hitherto an Assyrian colony.

[[Ashur-nirari IV]] took the throne in 1018 BC, and captured the Babylonian city of [[Atlila]] from [[Simbar-Shipak]] and continued Assyrian campaigns against the Arameans. He was eventually deposed by his uncle [[Ashur-rabi II]] in 1013 BC.

During the reign of [[Ashur-rabi II]] (1013–972 BC) Aramaean tribes took the cities of [[Pitru]] and [[Mutkinu]] (which had been taken and colonized by Tiglath Pileser I.) This event showed how far Assyria could assert itself militarily when the need arose. The Assyrian king attacked the Arameans, forced his way to the far off Mediterranean and constructed a [[stele]] in the area of [[Mount Atalur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=The Calculated Frightfulness of Ashur Nasir Pal|first=A.T.|last= Olmstead|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=38|year=1918|pages=209–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashur-resh-ishi II]] (971–968 BC) in all likelihood a fairly elderly man due to the length of his father's reign, had a largely uneventful period of rule, concerning himself with defending Assyria's borders and conducting various rebuilding projects within Assyria.

[[Tiglath-Pileser II]] (967–936 BC) succeeded him, and reigned for 28 years. He maintained the policies of his recent predecessors, but appears to have had an uneventful reign.

===Society in the Middle Assyrian period===
[[File:Assyrian troops return.png|thumb|Assyrian troops return after victory.]]
Assyria had difficulties with keeping the trade routes open. Unlike the situation in the Old Assyrian period, the Anatolian metal trade was effectively dominated by the [[Hittites]] and the [[Hurrians]]. These people now controlled the Mediterranean ports, while the [[Kassites]] controlled the river route south to the [[Persian Gulf]].

The Middle Assyrian kingdom was well organized, and in the firm control of the king, who also functioned as the High Priest of [[Anshar|Ashur]], the state god. He had certain obligations to fulfill in the cult, and had to provide resources for the temples. The priesthood became a major power in Assyrian society. Conflicts with the priesthood are thought to have been behind the murder of king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]].

The main Assyrian cities of the middle period were [[Assur|Ashur]], [[Kalhu]] ([[Nimrud]]) and [[Nineveh]], all situated in the [[Tigris]] River valley. At the end of the Bronze Age, Nineveh was much smaller than Babylon, but still one of the world's major cities (population c. 33,000). By the end of the Neo-Assyrian period, it had grown to a population of some 120,000, and was possibly the largest city in the world at that time.&lt;ref&gt;see [[historical urban community sizes]]. Estimates are those of Chandler (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; All free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time, a system which was called the ''ilku''-service. A legal code was produced during the 14th and 13th centuries which, among other things, clearly shows that the social position of women in Assyria was lower than that of neighbouring societies. Men were permitted to divorce their wives with no compensation paid to the latter. If a woman committed adultery, she could be beaten or put to death. It's not certain if these laws were seriously enforced, but they appear to be a backlash against some older documents that granted things like equal compensation to both partners in divorce. The women of the king's harem and their servants were also subject to harsh punishments, such as beatings, mutilation, and death. Assyria, in general, had much harsher laws than most of the region. Executions were not uncommon, nor were whippings followed by forced labour. Some offenses allowed the accused a trial under torture/duress. One tablet that covers property rights has brutal penalties for violators. A creditor could force debtors to work for him, but not sell them.

[[File:Flaying of rebels.jpg|thumb|Assyrians skinning or [[flaying]] their prisoners alive]]

The Middle Assyrian Period is marked by the long wars fought during this period that helped build Assyria into a warrior society. The king depended on both the citizen class and priests in his capital, and the landed nobility who supplied the horses needed by Assyria's military. Documents and letters illustrate the importance of the latter to Assyrian society. Assyria needed less artificial irrigation than Babylon, and horse-breeding was extensive. Portions of elaborate texts about the care and training of them have been found. Trade was carried out in all directions. The mountain country to the north and west of Assyria was a major source of metal ore, as well as lumber. Economic factors were a common ''casus belli''.

Assyrian architecture, like that of Babylonia, was influenced by [[Sumero-Akkadian]] styles (and to some degree Mitanni), but early on developed its own distinctive style. Palaces sported colourful wall decorations, and seal-cutting (an art learned from Mittani) developed apace. Schools for scribes taught both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of [[Akkadian]], and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian]] literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavour. The Assyrian dialect of Akkadian was used in legal, official, religious, and practical texts such as medicine or instructions on manufacturing items. During the 13th to 10th centuries, picture tales appeared as a new art form: a continuous series of images carved on square stone steles. Somewhat reminiscent of a comic book, these show events such as warfare or hunting, placed in order from the upper left to the lower right corner of the stele with captions written underneath them. These and the excellent cut seals show that Assyrian art was beginning to surpass that of Babylon. Architecture saw the introduction of a new style of [[ziggurat]], with two towers and colorful enameled tiles.

==Neo-Assyrian Empire, 911–612 BC==
[[File:Map of Assyria.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its expansions.]]
{{main|Neo-Assyrian Empire|Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire}}

[[Ashur-Dan II]] (935–912 BC) oversaw a marked economic and organisational upturn in the fortunes of Assyria, laying the platform for it to once again forge an empire. He is recorded as having made successful punitive raids outside the borders of Assyria to clear [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] and other tribal peoples from the regions surrounding Assyria in all directions. He concentrated on rebuilding Assyria within its natural borders, from [[Tur Abdin]] to [[Arrapha]] ([[Kirkuk]]), he built government offices in all provinces, and created a major economic boost by providing ploughs throughout the land, which yielded record grain production.

The Neo-Assyrian Empire is usually considered to have begun with the accession of [[Adad-nirari II]], in [[911 BC]], lasting until the fall of Nineveh at the hands of the [[Babylonians|Babylonians, Chaldeans]], [[Medes|Medes/Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] in 612 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=ae_chart Chart of World Kingdoms, Nations and Empires—All Empires]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion, 911–627 BC===
When the ancient Dark Ages (which for Assyria lasted from 1050 to 936 BC) finally lifted, the world had changed dramatically. Ancient kingdoms such as Assyria, Babylonia, Elam and Egypt still endured, the Hittites did also, in the form of smaller Neo-Hittite states. A number of new states had arisen during the tumultuous time between 1200 and 936 BC, such as; Persia, Media, Parthia, Mannea, Israel, Urartu, Phrygia, Lydia, the Aramean and Phoenician states of the Levant, Doric Greece, Putria (Libya), Colchia, Tabal, Nubia/Kush. In addition, other nations and peoples; such as Chaldea, Judah, Scythia, Cimmeria, Samaria, Ethiopia, Nabatea, Armenia and the Arabs were to emerge in the following centuries.

However, it was the ancient state of Assyria which would once more rise to prominence, and Assyria was to meet and defeat these new peoples, together with old foes, over the coming three centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot; /&gt;

Beginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]] (911-892 BC), Assyria once more became a great power, growing to be the greatest empire the world had yet seen. The new king firmly subjugated the areas that were previously only under nominal Assyrian vassalage, conquering and deporting troublesome [[Aramaeans|Aramean]], [[Neo-Hittite]] and [[Hurrian]] populations in the north to far-off places. Adad-nirari II then twice attacked and defeated [[Shamash-mudammiq]] of [[Babylonia]], annexing a large area of land north of the [[Diyala River]] and the towns of [[Hīt]] and [[Zanqu]] in mid Mesopotamia. Later in his reign, he made further gains against King [[Nabu-shuma-ukin I]] of [[Babylonia]]. He then conquered [[Kadmuh]] and [[Nisibin]] from the [[Arameans]], and secured the [[Khabur]] region.

His successor, [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] (891–884 BC) consolidated Assyria's gains and expanded into the [[Zagros Mountains]] in modern [[Iran]], subjugating the newly arrived [[Persian people|Persians]], Parthians and [[Medes]] as well as pushing into central [[Asia Minor]].
[[File:Assyrian Attack on a Town.jpg|thumb|Assyrian attack on a town with archers and a wheeled battering ram, 865–860 BC]]
[[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883–859 BC) was a fierce and ruthless ruler who advanced without opposition through [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] and [[Canaan]] (modern [[Syria]], [[Lebannon]], [[Jordan]] and [[Israel]]) and [[Asia Minor]] as far as the [[Mediterranean]] and conquered and exacted tribute from [[Aramea]], [[Phrygia]] and [[Phoenicia]] among others. Ashurnasirpal II also repressed revolts among the [[Medes]] and [[Persia]]ns in the Zagros Mountains, and moved his capital to the city of [[Kalhu]] ([[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]). The palaces, temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable development of wealth, science, architecture and art. He also built a number of new heavily fortified towns, such as [[Imgur-Enlil]] ([[Balawat]]), [[Tushhan]], [[Kar-Ashurnasirpal]] and [[Nibarti-Ashur]]. Ashurnasirpal II also had a keen interest in [[Botany]] and [[Zoology]]; collecting all manner of plants, seeds and animals to be displayed in Assyria.

[[Shalmaneser III]] (858–823 BC) had his authority challenged by a large alliance of a dozen nations, some of which were vassals, including; [[Babylonia]], [[Egypt]], [[Elam]], [[Persia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Hamath]], [[Phoenicia]], the [[Arabs]], [[Arameans]], [[Suteans]] and neo [[Hittites]] among others, fighting them to a standstill at the [[Battle of Qarqar]]. The failure of this alliance prevented pharaoh [[Osorkon II]] from regaining an Egyptian foothold in the Near East.

Subsequent to this, Shalmaneser III attacked and reduced [[Babylonia]] to vassalage, including subjugating the [[Chaldea]]n, [[Aramean]] and [[Sutean]] tribes settled within it. He then defeated [[Aramea]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]], [[Urartu]], [[Phoenicia]], the [[Neo-Hittite]] states and the desert dwelling [[Arabs]] of the Arabian Peninsula, forcing all of these to pay tribute to Assyria.

It is in Assyrian accounts of the 850's BC, recorded during the reign of [[Shalmaneser III]], that the [[Arab people|Arabs]] and [[Chaldea]]ns first enter the pages of written history.

His armies penetrated to [[The Caucasus]], [[Lake Van]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]]; the Hittites around Carchemish were compelled to pay tribute, and the kingdoms of [[Hamath]] and [[Aram Damascus]] were subdued. In 831 BC, he received the submission of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n kingdom of [[Tabal]]. He consolidated Assyrian control over the regions conquered by his predecessors and, by the end of his 27-year reign, Assyria was master of Mesopotamia, The Levant, western Iran, Israel, Jordan and much of Asia Minor. Due to old age, in the last 6 years of his reign he passed command of his armies to the &quot;Turtanu&quot; (General) [[Dayyan-Assur]].
[[File:Jehu-Obelisk-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Jehu]], king of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], bows before Shalmaneser III of Assyria, 825 BC]]
However, his successor, [[Shamshi-Adad V]] (822-811 BC) (also known as [[Shamshi-Ramman II]]), inherited an empire beset by civil war in Assyria itself. The first years of his reign saw a serious struggle for the succession of the aged Shalmaneser III. The revolt, which had broken out by 826 BC, was led by Shamshi-Adad's brother [[Assur-danin-pal]]. The rebellious brother, according to Shamshi-Adad's own inscriptions, succeeded in bringing to his side 27 important cities, including [[Nineveh]] and [[Babylon]]. The rebellion lasted until 820 BC, preventing Assyria expanding its empire further until it was quelled.

Later in his reign, Shamshi-Adad V successfully campaigned against both [[Babylonia]] and [[Elam]], and forced a treaty in Assyria's favour on the Babylonian king [[Marduk-zakir-shumi I]]. In [[814 BCE]], he won the battle of [[Dur-Papsukkal]] against the new Babylonian king [[Murduk-balassu-iqbi]], and went on to subjugate the immigrant tribes of [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Arameans|Aramean]]s, and [[Sutean]]s who had recently settled in parts of [[Babylonia]].

He was succeeded by [[Adad-nirari III]] (810–782 BC), who was merely a boy. The Empire was thus ruled by his mother, the famed queen [[Semiramis]] ([[Shammuramat]]), until 806 BC. [[Semiramis]] held the empire together, and appears to have campaigned successfully in subjugating the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Parthians]] and [[Medes]] during her regency, leading to the later [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] and also [[Greeks|Greek]] myths and legends surrounding her.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p.&amp;nbsp;301–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 806 BC, [[Adad-nirari III]] took the reins of power from [[Semiramis]]. He invaded the [[Levant]] and subjugated the [[Arameans]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Philistines]], [[Israelites]], [[Neo-Hittites]], [[Moabites]] and [[Edomites]]. He entered [[Damascus]] and forced tribute upon its [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] king [[Ben-Hadad III]]. He next turned eastward to [[Iran]], and subjugated the [[Persia]]ns, [[Medes]] and the pre Iranian [[Manneans]], penetrating as far north east as the [[Caspian Sea]]. He then turned south, forcing [[Babylonia]] to pay tribute. His next targets were the migrant [[Aramean]], [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldean]] and [[Sutu, Iran|Sutu]] tribes, who had settled in the far south eastern corner of Mesopotamia, whom he conquered and reduced to vassalage. Then the [[Arabs]] in the deserts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to the south of Mesopotamia were invaded, vanquished and forced to pay tribute also.
[[File:Human headed winged bull profile.jpg|right|thumb|A [[lamassu]] from the palace of Sargon II at [[Dur-Sharrukin]].]]

It is from this general period that the [[Cilician]] [[Indo-Anatolian]] term ''Surai'' ([[Syria]]) first appears in historical record in what is now called the [[Çineköy inscription]], not in reference to the region of [[Aramea]] now encompassing modern Syria in [[The Levant]], but specifically and only to Assyria itself.

Adad-nirari III died prematurely in 782 BC, which led to a temporary period of stagnation within the empire. Assyria continued its military dominance, however [[Shalmaneser IV]] (782 - 773 BC) himself seems to have wielded little personal authority, and a victory over [[Argishti I]], king of [[Urartu]] at [[Til Barsip]] is accredited to an Assyrian General ([[Turtanu]]) named [[Shamshi-ilu]], who does not even bother to mention his king. Shamshi-ilu also scored victories over the [[Arameans]], [[Phrygians]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Neo-Hittites]], and again, takes personal credit at the expense of his king.

[[Ashur-dan III]] ascended the throne in 772 BC. He proved to be a largely ineffectual ruler who was beset by internal rebellions in the cities of [[Ashur]], [[Arrapkha]] and [[Guzana]]; and his personal authority was checked by powerful generals, such as Shamshi-ilu. He failed to make any further gains in Babylonia, Canaan and [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. His reign was also marred by [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] and an ominous [[Solar Eclipse]] and, as with his predecessor, military victories were credited to Shamshi-ilu.

[[Ashur-nirari V]] became king in 754 BC, the early part of his reign seems to have been one of permanent internal revolution, and he apprears to have barely left his palace in [[Nineveh]]. However later in his reign he led a number of successful campaigns in [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Levant]]. He was deposed by [[Tiglath-pileser III]] in 745 BC bringing a resurgence to Assyrian expansion.

[[Tiglath-Pileser III]] (745–727 BC), a usurper whose original name was ''Pulu'', initiated a renewed period of Assyrian expansion; [[Urartu]], [[Persia]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Mannea]], [[Babylonia]], [[Arabia]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samaria]], [[Nabatea]], [[Chaldea]], [[Cyprus]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]] and the [[Neo-Hittites]] were subjugated, Tiglath-Pileser III was declared king in [[Babylon]] and the Assyrian empire was now stretched from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to [[Arabia]] and from the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Cyprus]]. 

Tiglath-Pileser III had reorganised the Assyrian army into the first professional fighting force in history, he also incorporated conquered peoples into the imperial army to serve as light infantry, thus expanding the size of the army. He greatly improved the civil administration of his empire, reducing the influence of hitherto powerful nobles, regional governors and viceroys, and deporting troublesome peoples to other parts of his vast empire, setting the template for all future ancient empires&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq''&lt;/ref&gt;
Tiglath-Pileser III also introduced [[Mesopotamian]] [[Eastern Aramaic]] as the ''Lingua Franca'' of Assyria and its vast empire, whose Akkadian infused descendant dialects still survive among the modern [[Assyrian Christian]] people to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shalmaneser V]] (726–723 BC) consolidated Assyrian power during his short reign, and repressed [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] attempts to gain a foothold in the near east, defeating and driving out Pharaoh [[Shoshenq V]] from the region. He is mentioned in Biblical sources as having conquered [[Israel]] the [[Samaritans]], and being responsible for deporting the [[Ten Lost Tribes of Israel]] to Assyria.

[[File:Loewenjagd -645-635 Niniveh.JPG|thumb|Relief showing a [[Lion hunting|lion hunt]], from the north palace of [[Nineveh]], 645-635 BC]]

[[Sargon II]] (722–705 BC) maintained the empire, driving the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] from [[Ancient Iran]], where they had invaded and attacked the [[Persia]]ns and [[Medes]], who were vassals of Assyria. [[Deioces]], king of the Medes and Persians was then forced to pay tribute after launching a failed rebellion against Assyria. When in 720 BCE a revolt occurred in [[Canaan]] against [[Sargon II]], king Hanno sought the help of Pharaoh [[Osorkon IV]] of the 22nd Dynasty of [[Egypt]]. The Egyptian king sent a general named [[Raia (general)|Raia]] as well as troops in order to support the neighboring ally. However, the coalition was defeated in battle at [[Rafah|Raphia]]: Raia fled back to Egypt, Raphia and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] were looted and Hanno was [[Death by burning|burnt alive]] by the Assyrians.&lt;ref name=kk&gt;Kitchen, op. cit., §§&amp;nbsp;333–36;&amp;nbsp;463–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G3412&gt;Grimal, op. cit., pp.&amp;nbsp;341–42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 716 BCE Sargon II crossed the Sinai and amassed an army on Egypt's border. Osorkon IV personally met the Assyrian king at the &quot;[[Brook of Egypt]]&quot; (most likely [[el-Arish]]) and was forced pay tribute to Sargon II to avoid being invaded.&lt;ref name=kk/&gt; [[Mannea]], [[Cilicia]] [[Cappadocia]] and [[Commagene]] were conquered, [[Urartu]] was ravaged, and [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Arabia]], [[Cyprus]] and the famed [[Midas]] (king of [[Phrygia]]) were forced to pay tribute. His ''stele'' has been found as far west as [[Larnaca]] in [[Cyprus]]. Sargon II conquered [[Gurgum]], [[Milid]], the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] state of [[Tabal]], and all of the Neo-[[Hittites|Hittite]] kingdoms of the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Egypt]], now under a new [[Nubia]]n dynasty, once again attempted to gain ground in the region by supporting [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel's]] rebellion against the empire, however Sargon II once again crushed the uprising, and [[Piye]] was routed and driven back over the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. Sargon II was killed in 705 BC while on a punitive raid against the [[Cimmerians]], and was succeeded by [[Sennacherib]].

[[Sennacherib]] (705-681 BC), a ruthless ruler, defeated the [[Greeks]] who were attempting to gain a foothold in [[Cilicia]], and then defeated and drove the [[Nubia]]n ruled [[Egyptians]] from the [[Near East]] where the new Nubian Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] had once again fomented revolt against Assyria among the [[Israelites]], [[Judeans]] and [[Canaanites]].

[[Sennacherib]] was forced to contend with a major revolt within his empire, which included a large alliance of subject peoples, including [[Babylonians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Medes]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Elamites]], [[Parthians]], [[Manneans]] and [[Arameans]]. The prime movers in this rebellion were [[Mushezib-Marduk]] of Babylonia, [[Achaemenes]] of Persia, [[Khumban-umena III]] of Elam, and [[Deioces]] of Media. The [[Battle of Halule]] was fought in 691 BC between Sennacherib and his enemies,  in which this vast alliance failed to overthrow Sennacherib. The Assyrian king was then able to subjugate these nations individually, [[Babylon]] was sacked and largely destroyed by Sennacherib.

He sacked [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], subjugated the [[Samaritans]] and laid siege to [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], forcing tribute upon it. He installed his own son [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]] as king in Babylonia. He maintained Assyrian domination over the Medes, Manneans and Persians to the east, Asia Minor and the southern Caucasus to the north and north west, and the Levant, Phoenicia and Aram in the west. Sennacherib's palace and garden at Nineveh have been proposed as the archetype of the Hanging Garden of Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Dalley (2013)''The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: an elusive world Wonder traced''OUP ISBN 978-0-19-966226-5&lt;/ref&gt; Sennacherib was murdered by his own sons (according to the Bible the sons were named [[Adrammelech]], [[Abimelech]] and Sharezer) in a palace revolt, apparently in revenge for the destruction of Babylon, a city sacred to all Mesopotamians, including the Assyrians.

[[Esarhaddon]] (680–669 BC) expanded Assyria still further, campaigning deep into the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in the north, defeating king [[Rusas II]] and breaking [[Urartu]] completely in the process. Esarhaddon campaigned successfully subjugating the [[Scythian]] king [[Ishpakaia]], and the [[Cimmerian]] king [[Teushpa]] in Asia Minor, and in Ancient Iran, the [[Manneans]], [[Gutians]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Phraortes]] the king of the [[Medes]] were subjugated.

To the west, the kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Edom]], [[Moab]], [[Israel]], [[Sidon]], [[Ekron]], [[Byblos]], [[Arvad]], [[Samarra]], [[Ammon]], [[Amalek]],  and the ten [[Greeks|Greek]] kings of [[Cyprus]], are listed as Assyrian subjects.

Tiring of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian interference in the Assyrian Empire, Esarhaddon decided to conquer Egypt. In 671 BC crossed the [[Sinai Desert]], and invaded and took [[Egypt]] with surprising ease and speed, driving its foreign [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] and [[Ethiopia]]n rulers out and destroying the [[Kushite Empire]] in the process.  Esarhaddon now declared himself &quot;king of [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], and [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]&quot;, and returned with rich booty from the cities of the delta; he erected a victory stele at this time, and paraded the captive Nubian Prince [[Ushankhuru]], the son of Taharqa in Nineveh. Esarhaddon stationed a small army in northern Egypt and describes how; &quot;All Ethiopians (read Nubians/Kushites) I deported from Egypt, leaving not one left to do homage to me&quot;.[69] He installed native Egyptian princes throughout the land to rule on his behalf.[70] The conquest by Esarhaddon effectively marked the end of the short lived Kushite Empire.

He expanded the empire as far south as [[Arabia]], [[Meluhha]] and [[Dilmun]] (modern [[Bahrain]] and [[Qatar]]).

[[Esarhaddon]] also completely rebuilt [[Babylon]] during his reign, bringing peace to Mesopotamia as a whole. The [[Babylonians]], [[Egyptians]], [[Elamites]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Manneans]], [[Arameans]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Israelites]], [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Urartu|Urartians]] were vanquished and regarded as vassals and Assyria's empire was kept secure.

He imposed a so-called ''Vassal Treaty'' upon his [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Median]] subjects, forcing [[Teispes]] of Persia and [[Deioces]] of Media to submit both to himself, and in advance to his chosen successor, Ashurbanipal.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson, Kirk A. (Autumn, 1987). &quot;Akkadian Treaties of Seventh Century BC&quot;. Journal of Cuneiform Studies 39 (2): p.130.: “... Esarhaddon imposes oaths to respect the right to succession of his two sons upon various peoples: the Medes in the Vassal Treaties and probably the people of Sippar in Text 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Esarhaddon died whilst preparing to leave for Egypt to once more eject the [[Nubians]], who were attempting to encroach on the southern part of the country. This task was successfully completed by his successor, [[Ashurbanipal]].

Under [[Ashurbanipal]] (669–627 BC), Assyrian domination spanned from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (modern [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]) in the north to [[Nubia]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]] and [[Arabia]] in the south, and from the [[East Mediterranean]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Antioch]] in the west to [[Persia]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] in the east.

He was an unusually educated man for his time, being able to read and write in Akkadian, Aramaic and Sumerian, and having a proficient understanding of Astronomy and Mathematics, as well as military, civil and political aptitude. He built the famed [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] which contained a multitude of ancient texts from all over Mesopotamia, and was the first library in history to classify works in order of genre.
[[File:Susa-destruction.jpg|thumb|Ashurbanipal's brutal campaign against [[Elam]] in 647 BCE is recorded in this relief.]]

Ashurbanipal began his rule by easily crushing the [[Nubia]]n/[[Kingdom of Kush|Cushite]] king [[Taharqa]], who had attempted to invade the southern part of Assyrian-controlled Egypt. [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] was sacked, and [[Taharqa]] was chased back into [[Nubia]] (modern [[Sudan]]) by a pursuing Assyrian army, and was never again to pose a threat. Ashurbanipal then put down a series of rebellions by the native Egyptians themselves, installing [[Necho I]] as a puppet Pharaoh. However in 664 BC, the new Nubian-Kushite king [[Tantamani]] once more attempted to invade Egypt, however he was savagely crushed, [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] was sacked and looted, and he fled to Nubia, bringing to an end, once and for all, Nubian designs on Egypt.

[[Phraortes]], the king of the [[Medes]] and Persians, also rebelled against Assyria, and attempted to attack Assyria itself in 653 BC, however he met with defeat at the hands of Ashurbanipal, and was killed. The succeeding Median kings, [[Madius]] and then [[Cyaxares the Great]], were both in turn subjugated by Ashurbanipal.

At around this time, [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]] king of [[Lydia]] in western Asia Minor, offered his submission to Ashurbanipal.

In 652 BC, just one year after his victory over Phraortes, his own brother [[Shamash-shum-ukin]], the Assyrian king of [[Babylon]] who had spent seventeen years peacefully subject to his sibling, became infused with Babylonian nationalism, declaring that Babylon and not Nineveh should be the seat of empire. Shamash-shum-ukin raised a powerful coalition of peoples resentful of being subject to Assyria, including- [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldeans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Arameans]], [[Suteans]], [[Arabs]], [[Elamites]], [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]], and even some [[Assyrians]]. War raged between the two brothers for five years, until in 648 BC, Babylon was sacked, and Shamash-shum-ukin slain. Ashurbanipal then wrought savage revenge, [[Elam]] was utterly destroyed, the Aramean, Chaldean, Sutean tribes were brutally punished, [[Arabia]]  was ravaged by the Assyrian army, and its rebellious shiekhs put to death. [[Cyrus I]] of [[Persia]] (grandfather of [[Cyrus the Great]]) was forced into submission, as a part of this defeated alliance.

Late in his reign, Ashurbanipal was forced to contend with renewed attempts on his empire by the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. The Scythians were able to once more ravage Assyria's Median and Persian colonies in [[Ancient Iran]] before being finally subdued, and the last decade or so of his reign seems to have been peaceful.

He built vast libraries and initiated a surge in the building of temples and palaces. After the crushing of the Babylonian revolt, Ashurbanipal appeared master of all he surveyed. To the east, [[Elam]] was devastated and prostrate before Assyria, the [[Manneans]] and the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Persia]]ns and Medes were vassals. To the south, [[Babylonia]] was occupied, the [[Chaldean people|Chaldeans]], [[Arabs]], [[Sutu, Iran|Sutu]] and [[Nabateans]] subjugated, the [[Nubia]]n empire destroyed, and [[Egypt]] paid tribute. To the north, the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] had been vanquished and driven from Assyrian territory, [[Urartu]] ([[Armenia]]), [[Phrygia]], [[Corduene]] and the neo [[Hittites]] were in vassalage, and [[Lydia]] pleading for Assyrian protection. To the west, [[Aramea]] ([[Syria]]), the [[Phoenicians]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samarra]] and [[Cyprus]] were subjugated, and the [[Hellenised]] inhabitants of [[Caria]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cappadocia]] and [[Commagene]] paid tribute to Assyria.

Assyria conquered the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty Egypt]] (expelling its [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] dynasty) as well as [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Elam]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Urartu]] ([[Armenia]]), [[Phoenicia]], [[Aramea]]/[[Syria]], [[Phrygia]], the [[Neo-Hittites|Neo-Hittite States]], the [[Hurrian|Hurrian lands]], [[Arabia]], [[Gutium]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samarra]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]], [[Corduene]], [[Cilicia]], [[Mannea]] and parts of [[Ancient Greece]] (such as [[Cyprus]]), and defeated and/or exacted tribute from [[Scythia]], [[Crimean Peninsula|Cimmeria]], [[Lydia]], [[Nubia]], [[Ethiopia]] and others.

At its height, the Empire encompassed the whole of the modern nations of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Palestine]] and [[Cyprus]], together with large swathes of [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Turkey]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]].

Assyria now appeared stronger than ever. However, the long struggles pacifying the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Arameans and Elamites, the exertions undertaken in keeping the Medes, Scythians, Persians, Urartians and Cimmerians subjugated, and the constant campaigning over three centuries to control and expand its vast empire in all directions, had left Assyria exhausted.

It had been drained of wealth and manpower; the devastated provinces could yield nothing to supply the needs of the imperial exchequer, it was difficult to find sufficient troops to garrison and effectively control the huge empire, and after the death of Ashurbanipal severe civil unrest broke out in Assyria itself, and the empire began to unravel.

===Downfall, 626–605 BC===
The Assyrian Empire was severely crippled following the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC—the nation and its empire descending into a prolonged and brutal series of civil wars involving three rival kings, [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] and [[Sin-shar-ishkun]]. [[Egypt]]'s 26th Dynasty, which had been installed by the Assyrians as vassals, quietly detached itself from Assyria, although it was careful to retain friendly relations.

[[Ashur-etil-ilani]] came to the throne in 626 BC, and was immediately beset by a series of internal civil wars. He was deposed in 623 BC, after four years of bitter fighting by [[Sin-shumu-lishir]], an Assyrian ''Turtanu'' (General) who also occupied and claimed the throne of [[Babylon]] in that year. In turn, Sin-shumu-lishir was deposed as ruler of Assyria and Babylonia after a year of warfare by [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] (622–612 BC)—who was then himself faced with constant violent rebellion in the Assyrian homeland.

This situation led to wholesale revolution in [[Babylonia]], and during the reign of [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] many Assyrian colonies to the west, east and north similarly took advantage and ceased to pay tribute to Assyria, most significantly the [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns and [[Arameans]].

The Scythians and Cimmerians took advantage of the bitter fighting among the Assyrians to raid Assyrian colonies, with hordes of horse borne marauders ravaging parts of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], where the vassal kings of [[Urartu]] and [[Lydia]] begged their Assyrian overlord for help in vain. They also raided the [[Levant]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (where [[Ashkelon]] was sacked by the Scythians) and all the way into [[Egypt]] whose coasts were ravaged and looted with impunity.

The [[Iranic]] peoples (the [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Parthians]]), aided by the previous Assyrian destruction of the hitherto dominant [[Elamites]] of [[Ancient Iran]], also took advantage of the upheavals in Assyria to coalesce into a powerful Median dominated force which destroyed the ''pre-Iranic'' Assyrian vassal kingdom of [[Mannea]] and absorbed the remnants of the pre-Iranic [[Elamites]] of southern Iran, and the equally pre-Iranic [[Gutians]], [[Manneans]] and [[Kassites]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].

In [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] (modern [[Syria]]), [[Phoenicia]] and southern [[Canaan]] (modern [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Sinai]] and [[Palestine]]), the various Aramean, Phoenician and Jewish states quietly reasserted their independence, and in western Asia Minor and eastern [[Mediterranean sea (oceanography)|Mediterranean]], the [[Lydians]], [[Greeks]], [[Cilicians]], [[Carians]], [[Cappadocia]]n and [[Luwian]] states did the same. [[Armenians]], [[Sarmatians]] and [[Colchians]] ([[Georgians]]) also began to establish themselves in parts of the Caucasus.

By 620 BC, [[Nabopolassar]], (a previously unknown ''Malka'' of the [[Chaldea]]n tribes who had settled the far southeast of [[Mesopotamia]] circa 900 BC) had claimed the city of Babylon and swathes of Babylonia in the confusion. Sin-shar-ishkun amassed a large army to eject Nabopolassar from Babylon; however, yet another massive revolt broke out in Assyria proper, forcing the bulk of his army to turn back, where they promptly joined the rebels in [[Nineveh]]. Similarly, Nabopolassar was unable to gain control over all of Babylonia, and could not make any inroads into Assyria despite its weakened state, being repelled at every attempt. The next four years saw bitter fighting in the heart of Babylonia itself, as the Assyrians tried to wrest back control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot; /&gt;

However, in 615 BC Nabopolassar entered into an alliance with the Median king [[Cyaxares the Great]], a hitherto vassal of Assyria, who had taken advantage of the upheavals in Assyria to free the Iranian peoples from Assyrian vassalage and unite the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Parthians]], together with the remnants of the pre-Iranian [[Elamites]], [[Gutians]], [[Kassites]] and [[Manneans]], into a powerful Median-dominated force. 

Mass alliances against Assyria were not a new phenomenon.  During the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365-1020 BC), peoples such as the [[Hittites]], [[Babylonians]], [[Mitanni]], [[Hurrians]], [[Elamites]], [[Phrygians]], [[Kassites]], [[Arameans]], [[Gutians]] and [[Canaanites]] had formed various coalitions at different times in vain attempts to break Assyrian power. During the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]], in the reigns of [[Shalmaneser III]] in the 9th century BC, [[Sargon II]] in the 8th century BC, and [[Sennacherib]] and [[Ashurbanipal]] in the earlier part of the 7th century BC, combined attempts to break Assyrian dominance by alliances including at different times; [[Babylonians]], [[Egyptians]], [[Greeks]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Elamites]], [[Nubians]], [[Medes]], [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldeans]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Canaanites]], [[Lydians]], [[Arameans]], [[Suteans]], [[Israelites]], [[Judean]]s, [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Manneans]], [[Urartians]], [[Cilicians]], [[Neo-Hittites]] and [[Arabs]] had all failed, Assyria being strong, well led and united, at the height of its power, and able to deal with any threat. 

However the nation at this time was in a severely depleted state, ravaged by over a decade of internal civil war, disunity, instability, economic crisis and battle fatigue, and the forces ranged against it from all sides were to prove too much for the severely weakened Assyrians.

While Sin-shar-ishkun was fighting both the home grown rebels in Assyria and the Chaldeans and Babylonians in southern Mesopotamia, [[Cyaxares]] (technically a vassal of Assyria), in an alliance with the Scythians and Cimmerians, launched a surprise attack on a civil war bleaguered Assyria in 615 BC, sacking Kalhu (the Biblical Calah/Nimrud) and taking Arrapkha (modern Kirkuk). Nabopolassar, still pinned down in southern Mesopotamia, was completely uninvolved in this major breakthrough against Assyria.

However, from this point, the alliance of [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Babylonians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] fought in unison against Assyria.

Despite the sorely depleted state of Assyria, bitter fighting ensued; throughout 614 BC the alliance of powers continued to gradually make hard fought inroads into Assyria itself, however in 613 BC the Assyrians somehow rallied against the odds and scored a number of counter attacking victories over the Medes-Persians, Babylonians-Chaldeans and Scythians-Cimmerians. 

This led to the coalition of forces ranged against it to unite and launch a massive combined attack in 612 BC, finally besieging and entering Nineveh in late 612 BC, with Sin-shar-ishkun being slain in the bitter street by street fighting. 

Despite the loss of almost all of its major cities, and in the face of overwhelming odds, Assyrian resistance continued. [[Ashur-uballit II]] (612- 605 BC) took the throne amid the street by street fighting in Nineveh, and refused a request to bow in vassalage to Nabopolassar, Cyaxares and their allies. He managed to break out of Nineveh and successfully fight his way to the northern Assyrian city of [[Harran]], he took the city and founded it as a new capital. Ashur-uballit II somehow managed to keep control of a now greatly reduced Assyria for five years or so, repelling attacks by his enemies. However, Harran too was eventually besieged and taken by the Medes, Babylonians and Scythians in 608 BC, with Ashur-uballit II once more managing to break free of the siege.

[[Egypt]], itself a former Assyrian colony whose current dynasty had been installed as puppet rulers by the Assyrians, then came to the aid of its former master, possibly in fear that without Assyrian protection it would be next to succumb, having already been ravaged by the Scythians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot; /&gt;

[[Ashur-uballit II]] and [[Necho II|Necho]] of Egypt made a failed attempt to recapture Harran in 608 BC. The next three years saw the remnants of the Assyrian army and their Egyptian allies vainly attempting to eject the invaders from Assyria. In 605 BC, the Babylonians, Scythians and Medes-Persians defeated the Assyrians and Egyptians at [[Carchemish]].

Sections of the Assyrian army retreated to the western corner of Assyria after the fall of Harran and Carchemish, and a number of Assyrian imperial records survive between 604 BC and 599 BC in and around the Assyrian city of [[Dur-Katlimmu]] in what is today north eastern Syria, and so it is possible that remnants of the Assyrian administration and army still continued to hold out in the region for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid; also Assyria 1995: Proceedings of the 10th Anniversary Symposium of the Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project / Helsinki, September 7-11, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fate of [[Ashur-uballit II]] remains unknown, his [[Limmu Lists]] end after the fall of Harran, and it is possible he was either killed at this time, at the battle of Carshemish in 605 BC, or continued to fight on, eventually simply disappearing into obscurity.

Certainly by 599 BC at the very latest, Assyria had been destroyed as an independent political entity, although it was to launch major rebellions against the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 546 BC and 520 BC, and remained a [[geo-political]] region, ethnic entity and colonised province until the late 7th century AD, with small Assyrian states emerging in the region between the 2nd century BC and 4th century AD.

==Assyria after the empire==
{{see also|Achaemenid Assyria}}

===Achaemenid Assyria, Athura, Assuristan, Assyria province, Adiabene, Osroene and Hatra===
Assyria was initially ruled by the short lived [[Median Empire]] (605-549 BC) after its fall. In a twist of fate, [[Nabonidus]] the last king of Babylon (together with his son and co-regent [[Belshazzar]]) was himself an Assyrian from [[Harran]]. He had overthrown the short lived [[Chaldea]]n dynasty in Babylonia, after which the Chaldeans disappeared from history, being fully absorbed into the native population of Babylonia. However, apart from plans to dedicate religious temples in the city of Harran, Nabonidus showed little interest in rebuilding Assyria. [[Nineveh]] and [[Kalhu]] remained in ruins with only small numbers of Assyrians living within them, conversely a number of towns and cities such as [[Arrapkha]], [[Guzana]], [[Nohadra]] and [[Harran]] remained intact, and [[Assur]] and [[Arbil|Arbela]] ([[Irbil]]) were not completely destroyed, as is attested by their later revival. However, Assyria spent much of this short period in a degree of devastation following its fall.

====[[Achaemenid Assyria]] (549–330 BC)====
After the Medes were overthrown by the [[Persian people|Persians]] as the dominant force in Ancient Iran, Assyria was ruled by the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] (as [[Athura]]) from 549 BC to 330 BC (see [[Achaemenid Assyria]]). Between 546 and 545 BC, Assyria rebelled against the new Persian Dynasty, which had usurped the previous Median dynasty. The rebellion centered around [[Tyareh]] was eventually quashed by [[Cyrus the Great]].

Assyria seems to have recovered dramatically, and flourished during this period. It became a major agricultural and administrative centre of the Achaemenid Empire, and its soldiers were a mainstay of the Persian Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |title=Assyrians after Assyria|publisher=Nineveh.com |date=4 September 1999 |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110714183623/http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html| archivedate= 14 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Assyria even became powerful enough to raise another full-scale revolt against the Persian empire in 520–519 BC.

The Persians had spent centuries under Assyrian domination (their first ruler [[Achaemenes]], having been a vassal of Assyria), and Assyrian influence can be seen in Achaemenid art, infrastructure and administration. Early Persian rulers saw themselves as successors to [[Ashurbanipal]], and [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] was retained as the ''lingua franca'' of the empire for over two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Van de Mieroop, ''History'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nineveh]] was never rebuilt however, and 200 years after it was sacked [[Xenophon]] reported only small numbers of Assyrians living amongst its ruins. Conversely the ancient city of [[Assur]] once more became a rich and prosperous entity.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, John (November 2003). &quot;The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq&quot;. L’archéologie de l’empire achéménide (Paris, France): 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Macedonian and Seleucid Assyria====
In 332 BC, Assyria fell to [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Emperor from [[Greece]], who called the inhabitants ''Assyrioi''. The [[Macedonian Empire]] (332-312) was partitioned in 312 BC. It thereafter became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] (312 BC) and was renamed [[Syria]], a [[Hurrian]], [[Luwian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] corruption of '''Assyria''', a term which for many centuries until the Seleucid era had only and specifically meant and referred to Assyria and the Assyrians, and not to [[The Levant]] and its largely Aramean, Phoenician and Neo-Hittite inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf |title=The Terms &quot;Assyria&quot; and &quot;Syria&quot; Again|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110613170304/http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf| archivedate= 13 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is from this period that the later [[Name of Syria|''Syria'' Vs ''Assyria'' naming controversy arises]], the Seleucids applied the name not only to Assyria itself, but also to the Levantine lands to the west (historically known as [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] modern [[Syria]]/[[Eber Nari]]), which had been part of the Assyrian empire but never a part of Assyria. 

When they lost control of Assyria, the name ''Syria'' survived but was erroneously applied only to the land of [[Aramea]] (also known as [[Eber Nari]]) to the west that had once been part of the Assyrian empire, but apart from the north eastern corner, had never been a part of Assyria itself, nor inhabited by Assyrians. This was to lead to both the Assyrians from Northern Mesopotamia and the Arameans and Phoenicians from the Levant being collectively dubbed '''Syrians''' (and later also '''Syriacs''') in [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] culture, regardless of ethnicity, history or geography.

During Seleucid rule, Assyrians ceased to hold the senior military and civil positions they had enjoyed under the Achaemenids, being largely replaced by Greeks. The Greek language also replaced Mesopotamian East Aramaic as the lingua franca of the empire, although this did not affect the Assyrian population themselves, who were not Hellenised during the Seleucid era.

During the Seleucid period in southern Mesopotamia, [[Babylon]] was gradually abandoned in favour of a new city named [[Dura Seleucus]], effectively bringing an end to ''Babylonia''.

====Parthian Assyria (150 BC – 116 AD); [[Adiabene]] (69 BC – 117 AD)====
By 150 BC, Assyria was largely under the control of the [[Parthian Empire]], once more as [[Athura]] (the Mesopotamian East Aramaic word for Assyria). The Parthians seem to have exercised only loose control over Assyria. Temples to the native gods of Assyria were resurrected in many towns and cities. A number of independent [[Neo-Assyrian]] states arose, the most notable being [[Adiabene]] (69 BC - 117 AD). Adiabene was described by historian [[Georges Roux]] as a virtual resurrection of Assyria.

The Assyrians began to convert to [[Christianity]] from [[Mesopotamian religion]] ([[Ashurism]]) during the period between the early 1st and 3rd centuries AD, with the founding of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].

====Roman Assyria (116 AD – 118 AD)====
However, in 116 AD, under [[Trajan]], Assyria and its independent states were taken over by Rome as the [[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Province of Assyria]]. The Assyrian kingdom of [[Adiabene]] was destroyed as an independent state during this period. Roman rule lasted only a few years, and the Parthians once more regained control with the help of the Assyrians, who were incited to overthrow the Roman garrisons by the Parthian king.
However, a number of Assyrians were conscripted into the [[Roman Army]], with many serving in the region of [[Hadrians Wall]] in [[Ancient Britain]], and inscriptions in Aramaic made by [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Aramean]] soldiers have been discovered in northern [[England]] dating from the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/oct/13/hadrians-wall&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parthian Assyria restored (119 AD – 225 AD), [[Osroene]], [[Hatra]]====
[[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Parthians]] fought over Assyria and the rest of Mesopotamia for the next century, allowing a number of other Neo-Assyrian states to arise, namely [[Osroene]] (132 BC to AD 244) and [[Hatra]] (155–241 AD). Osroene became the first [[Christian]] state in history, and a major center of [[Syriac literature]] and [[Syriac Christianity]].

In addition, the ancient capital city of [[Ashur]] again flourished, and appears to have gained independence during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. Temples to the Assyrian national gods [[Ashur]], [[Sin]], [[Hadad]], [[Ishtar]] and [[Shamash]] were once more dedicated throughout Assyria during this period. The noted Assyriologist [[Simo Parpola]] has speculated that Assyria may well have once again been fully independent for a while.

====Sassanid Assyria ([[Assuristan]] (226 AD – circa 650 AD)====
In 226 AD, Assyria was largely taken over by the [[Sassanid Empire]]. After driving out the Romans and Parthians, the Sassanid rulers set about destroying the independent states within Assyria; Hatra was dissolved in 241 AD, Osroene in 244 AD and Assur was sacked by [[Shapur I]] in 256 AD.

It was known as [[Asuristan]] (the Sassanid name for Assyria) during this period, and became the birthplace of the [[Church of the East]] (now split into the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]), with a flourishing [[Syriac]] ([[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]) Christian culture which exists there to this day. Temples were still being dedicated to the national god [[Ashur]] in his home city and in [[Harran]] during the 4th century, indicating an Assyrian identity was still strong.

During the Sassanid period, much of what had once been [[Babylonia]] in southern Mesopotamia was incorporated into Assyria.

Parts of Assyria appear to have been semi independent as late as the latter part of the 4th century AD, with a king named [[Sennacherib II]] ruling the northern reaches in 370s AD.

==Assyrians after Assyria==
{{see also|Assyrian continuity|Assyrian People}}
Centuries of constant warfare between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Sassanid Empire]] left both empires exhausted, depleted and battle-fatigued, allowing the Muslim Arabs to break from the [[Arabian peninsula]] and invade territories hitherto held by these empires. After the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th century, Assyria was dissolved as an entity, although the native Assyrian population still regarded the region as [[Athura]], an appellation which survived until the 19th century AD. Under Arab rule, Mesopotamia as a whole underwent a gradual process of [[Arabisation]] and [[Islamification]], and the region saw a gradual large influx of ''non indigenous'' [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[Kurds]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], and [[Turkic peoples]]. However, the indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population of northern Mesopotamia (known as [[Ashuriyun]] by the Arabs) resisted this process, retaining their language, religion, culture and identity.

The previously basic civilisation of the desert dwelling Arabs was greatly enhanced and enriched by the influence and knowledge of native Mesopotamian scientists, physicians, mathematicians, theologians, astronomers, architects, agriculturalists, artists and astrologers.
[[File:Syriac Christianity.svg|thumb|Aramaic language and [[Syriac Christianity]] in the Middle East and Central Asia until being largely annihilated by [[Tamerlane]] in the 14th century.]]

However, despite this, indigenous Assyrians became second class citizens in a greater Arab Islamic state, and those who resisted Arabisation and conversion to Islam were subject to religious, ethnic and cultural discrimination, and had certain restrictions imposed upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Bennett (2005). Muslims and Modernity: An Introduction to the Issues and Debates. Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 163. ISBN 082645481X. Retrieved 2012-07-07&lt;/ref&gt; They were excluded from specific duties and occupations reserved for Muslims, did not enjoy the same political rights as Muslims, their word was not equal to that of a Muslim in legal and civil matters, as Christians they were subject to payment of a special tax ([[jizyah]]), they were banned from spreading their religion further in Muslim ruled lands, men were banned from marrying Muslim women, but at he same time they were also expected to adhere to the same laws of property, contract and obligation as the Muslim Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;H. Patrick Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World. Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although predominantly Christian, a minority of Assyrians still held onto their ancient Mesopotamian religion until as late as the 10th century AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;nineveh.com&quot;&gt;http://www.nineveh.com/parpola_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrian people, still retaining [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] infused and influenced [[Eastern Aramaic]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East]] [[Christianity]], remained dominant in the north of Mesopotamia (what had been Assyria) as late as the 14th century AD&lt;ref&gt;According to Georges Roux and Simo Parpola&lt;/ref&gt; and the city of [[Assur]] was still occupied by Assyrians during the Islamic period until the mid-14th century when the [[Muslim]] Turco-Mongol ruler [[Tamurlane]] conducted a religiously motivated massacre of indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]]. After that, there are no traces of a settlement at Ashur in the archaeological and numismatic record, and from this point the Assyrian population was dramatically reduced in their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assur.de/Themen/Stadtgeschichte_Engl/body_stadtgeschichte_engl.html |title=History of Ashur |publisher=Assur.de |date= |accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A religious [[schism]] among the Assyrians of northern Mesopotamia emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries AD, when a large number of hitherto [[Assyrian Church of the East]] Assyrians from the far north of Mesopotamia entered communion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] after becoming dissatisfied with the [[Abuna]] family's leadership of the Assyrian Church, and after at first failing to gain acceptance within the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. Rome named this new church ''The Church of Assyria and Mosul'' and its first leader ''Patriarch of the East Assyrians'' in 1553 AD. However in 1683 AD, Rome altered the name to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], this group of Assyrians eventually became known as [[Chaldean Catholics]] or [[Chaldo-Assyrians]] despite having no ethnic, historical, linguistic or geographic connections whatsoever to the long extinct Chaldean tribe of south east Mesopotamia.

The Assyrians suffered a number of religiously and ethnically motivated massacres throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries AD,&lt;ref&gt;Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. pp. 218–219. ISBN 978-1-60497-583-3.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in the large scale [[Hamidian massacres]] of unarmed men, women and children by [[Muslim]] [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurds]] in the late 19th century, which further greatly reduced numbers, particularly in southeastern Turkey.

[[File:Burning of Assyrians.jpg|thumb|The burning of bodies of Christian Assyrian women]]
The Assyrians suffered a further catastrophic series of massacres known as the [[Assyrian Genocide]], at the hands of the [[Ottomans]] and their [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] and [[Arab]] allies from 1915–1918. The genocide (committed in conjunction with the [[Armenian Genocide]] and [[Greek Genocide]]) accounted for up to 300,000 unarmed Assyrian civilians, and the forced deportations of many more. The sizeable Assyrian presence in south eastern Asia Minor which had endured for over four millennia was reduced to a few thousand. As a consequence, the surviving Assyrians took up arms, and an [[Assyrian war of independence]] was fought during [[World War I]], For a time, the Assyrians fought successfully against overwhelming numbers, scoring a number of victories over the Ottomans and Kurds, and also hostile Arab and Iranian groups; then their [[Russia]]n allies left the war following the [[Russian Revolution]], and [[Armenia]]n resistance broke. The Assyrians were left cut off, surrounded, and without supplies, forcing those in Asia Minor and Northwest Iran to fight their way, with civilians in tow, to the safety of [[United Kingdom|British]] lines and their fellow Assyrians in northern Iraq.

The [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings, such as [[Rab-shakeh]], [[Rab-talia]] and Tartan, being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline, and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds, guard the borders with Iran and Turkey and protect British military installations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Len Deighton]] (1993), ''[[Blood, Tears and Folly]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After Iraq was granted independence by the British in 1933, the Assyrians suffered the [[Simele Massacre]], where thousands of unarmed villagers (men, women and children) were slaughtered by joint Arab-Kurdish forces of the Iraqi Army. These massacres followed a clash between Assyrian tribesmen and the Iraqi army, where the Iraqi forces suffered a defeat after trying to disarm the Assyrians, whom they feared would attempt to secede from Iraq. Armed Assyrian Levies were prevented by the British from going to the aid of these civilians.

The Assyrians were allied with the British during [[World War II]], with eleven Assyrian companies seeing action in [[Palestine]]/[[Israel]] and another four serving in [[Cyprus]]. The Parachute Company was attached to the Royal Marine Commando and was involved in fighting in [[Albania]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. Assyrians played a major role in the victory over Arab-Iraqi forces at the [[Battle of Habbaniya]] in 1941, when the Iraqi government decided to join WW2 on the side of [[Nazi Germany]]. The British presence in Iraq lasted until 1955, and Assyrian Levies remained attached to British forces until this time.

The period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians. The regime of President Kassim in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, others were well represented in politics and the military, their towns and villages flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel, and be over represented in sports such as Boxing, Football, Athletics, Wrestling and Swimming.
[[File:Assyrian wedding, Mechelen.jpg|thumb|180px|Assyrian wedding, diaspora in Belgium]]

However in 1963, the [[Ba'ath Party]] took power by force in Iraq. The Baathists, though secular, were [[Arab Nationalists]], and set about attempting to ''Arabize'' the many non Arab peoples of Iraq, including the Assyrians. Other ethnic groups targeted for forced ''Arabization'' included [[Kurds]], [[Armenians]], [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turcomans]], [[Mandeans]], [[Yezidi]], [[Shabaki]], [[Kawliya]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Circassians]]. This policy included refusing to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group, banning the publication of written material in Eastern Aramaic, and banning its teaching in schools, banning parents giving Assyrian names to their children, banning Assyrian political parties, taking control of Assyrian churches, attempting to divide Assyrians on denominational lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox) and forced relocations of Assyrians from their traditional homelands to major cities.

In response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the [[Zowaa]] movement within the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] took up armed struggle against the Iraqi regime in 1982 under the leadership of [[Yonadam Kanna]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zowaa.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and then joined up with the [[Iraqi-Kurdistan Front|IKF]] in early 1990s. Yonadam Kanna in particular was a target of the [[Saddam Hussein]] Ba'ath regime for many years.

The policies of the Bathists have also long been mirrored in Turkey, whose governments have refused to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group since the 1920s, and have attempted to ''Turkify'' the Assyrians by calling them ''Semitic Turks'' and forcing them to adopt Turkic names. In Syria too, the Assyrian/Syriac Christians have faced pressure to identify as ''Arab Christians''.

Many persecutions have befallen the Assyrians since, such as the [[Anfal]] campaign and [[Baathist]], Arab and Kurdish nationalist and [[Islamist]] persecutions.

In recent years, the Assyrians in northern Iraq and north east Syria have become the target of extreme unprovoked [[Islamic terrorism]]. As a result, Assyrians have taken up arms, alongside other groups (such as the Kurds, Turcomans and Armenians) in response to unprovoked attacks by [[Al Qaeda]], [[ISIS]]/[[ISIL]], [[Nusra Front]] and other [[terrorist]] [[Islamic Fundamentalist]] groups. In 2014 Islamic terrorists of ISIS attacked Assyrian towns and villages in the [[Assyrian Homeland]] of northern Iraq, together with cities such as [[Mosul]] and [[Kirkuk]] which have large Assyrian populations. There have been reports of atrocities committed by ISIS terrorists since, including; beheadings, crucifixions, child murders, rape, forced conversions, [[Ethnic Cleansing]], robbery, and extortion in the form of illegal taxes levied upon non Muslims. Assyrians in Iraq have responded by forming armed militias to defend their territories.

Thus far, the only people who have been attested with a high level of genetic, historical, linguistic and cultural research to be the descendants of the ancient Mesopotamians are the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]] of [[Iraq]] and its surrounding areas in north west [[Iran]], north east [[Syria]] and south eastern [[Turkey]] (see [[Assyrian continuity]]), although others have made unsubstantiated claims of continuity. Assyria continued to exist as a geopolitical entity until the Arab-Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century, and Assyrian identity, personal, family and tribal names, and both spoken and written evolutions of [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] (which still contain many [[Akkadian]] loan words and an Akkadian grammatical structure) have survived among the Assyrian people from ancient times to this day. (see [[Assyrian people]]).

==Assyrian religion==
The Assyrians, like the rest of the Mesopotamian peoples, followed the [[Sumero-Akkadian]] [[Mesopotamian Religion]], with the national god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] having pride of place at the head of the pantheon. This religion survived in Assyria from c. 3500 BC through to its gradual decline in the face of Christianity between the 1st and 10th centuries AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;nineveh.com&quot;/&gt;

Other major gods within the pantheon were [[Anu]], [[Baal]], [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]], [[Enlil]], [[Ishtar]] ([[Astarte]]), [[Shamash]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adad]]/[[Hadad]], [[Sin (mythology)|Sin (Nanna)]], [[Dagon|Dagan]], [[Ninurta]], [[Nisroch]], [[Nergal]], [[Tiamat]], [[Ninlil]], [[Mullissu]], [[Zababa]] and [[El (deity)|El]].

Native religion was still strongly followed at least until the 4th century AD, and survived in pockets until at least the 10th century AD,&lt;ref name=&quot;nineveh.com&quot;/&gt; although Assyrians had begun to adopt [[East Syrian Rite|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]] (as well as for a time [[Manicheanism]] and [[Gnosticism]]) which, like [[Syriac]] literature, had its birthplace in Assyria between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD. Assyrians today are exclusively [[Christian]], with most following the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]] and [[Syriac Orthodox]] churches.

==Language==
During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Akkadian language|Akkad]]ians, which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].&lt;ref name='Deutscher'&gt;{{cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20–21|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] on [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.&lt;ref name='Deutscher'/&gt; This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.&lt;ref name='Deutscher'/&gt;

[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot;/&gt; but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

In ancient times, Assyrians spoke a dialect of the [[Akkadian language]], an eastern branch of the [[Semitic languages]]. The first inscriptions, called Old Assyrian (OA), were made in the Old Assyrian period.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; In the Neo-Assyrian period the [[Aramaic language]] became increasingly common,&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; more so than [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]—this was thought to be largely due to the mass deportations undertaken by Assyrian kings,&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382&quot;&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; in which large Aramaic-speaking populations, conquered by the Assyrians, were relocated to Assyria and interbred with the Assyrians. The ancient Assyrians also used the [[Sumerian language]] in their literature and liturgy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382&quot;/&gt; although to a more limited extent in the Middle- and Neo-Assyrian periods, when Akkadian became the main literary language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382&quot;/&gt;

The destruction of the Assyrian capitals of Nineveh and Assur by the Babylonians, Medes and their allies, ensured that much of the bilingual elite (but not all) were wiped out. By the 7th century BC, much of the Assyrian population used Akkadian influenced Eastern Aramaic and not Akkadian itself. The last Akkadian inscriptions in Mesopotamia date from the 1st century AD. However, Eastern Aramaic dialects, as well as Akkadian and Mesopotamian Aramaic personal and family names, still survive to this day among [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] in the regions of northern [[Iraq]], southeast [[Turkey]], northwest [[Iran]] and northeast [[Syria]] that constituted old Assyria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382&quot;/&gt;

After 90 years of effort, the [[University of Chicago]] has published an Assyrian Dictionary, whose form is more [[encyclopedia]] in style than [[dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110604/ap_on_re_us/us_postcard_the90_year_dictionary_project |title=Ancient world dictionary finished—after 90 years|agency= Associated Press |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=4 June 2011 |accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrian art preserved to the present day predominantly dates to the Neo-Assyrian period. Art depicting battle scenes, and occasionally the impaling of whole villages in gory detail, was intended to show the power of the emperor, and was generally made for propaganda purposes. These stone reliefs lined the walls in the royal palaces where foreigners were received by the king. Other stone reliefs depict the king with different deities and conducting religious ceremonies. Many stone reliefs were discovered in the royal palaces at [[Nimrud]] (Kalhu) and [[Khorsabad]] (Dur-Sharrukin). A rare discovery of metal plates belonging to wooden doors was made at [[Balawat]] ([[Imgur-Enlil]]).

[[File:S03 06 01 017 image 2350.jpg|thumbnail|Assyria. Head of winged bull, 9th c. B.C.; Brooklyn Museum Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
Assyrian sculpture reached a high level of refinement in the Neo-Assyrian period. One prominent example is the winged bull ''Lamassu'', or [[shedu]] that guard the entrances to the king's court. These were apotropaic meaning they were intended to ward off evil. C. W. Ceram states in ''The March of Archaeology'' that ''lamassi'' were typically sculpted with five legs so that four legs were always visible, whether the image were viewed frontally or in profile.

Although works of precious gems and metals usually do not survive the ravages of time, some fine pieces of Assyrian jewelry were found in royal tombs at Nimrud.

There is ongoing discussion among academics over the nature of the [[Nimrud lens]], a piece of [[quartz]] unearthed by [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1850, in the Nimrud palace complex in northern [[Iraq]]. A small minority believe that it is evidence for the existence of ancient Assyrian telescopes, which could explain the great accuracy of [[Assyrian astronomy]]. Other suggestions include its use as a magnifying glass for jewellers, or as a decorative furniture inlay. The Nimrud Lens is held in the British Museum.&lt;ref name = &quot;Muſeum&quot;&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369215&amp;partid=1 Lens], British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyrians were also innovative in military technology, with the use of heavy cavalry, sappers, siege engines etc.

{{main|Achaemenid Assyria|Assyriology|Assyrianism}}
[[File:Layard Nineveh.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Austen Henry Layard]] in Nineveh, 1852]]
[[Achaemenid]] Assyria (539–330 BC) retained a separate identity ([[Athura]]), official correspondence being in [[Imperial Aramaic]], and there was even a determined revolt of the two Assyrian provinces of Mada and Athura in 520 BC. Under [[Seleucid]] rule (330 BC – approximately 150 BC), however, [[Aramaic]] gave way to [[Greek language|Greek]] as the official administrative language. Aramaic was marginalised as an official language, but remained spoken in both Assyria and Babylonia by the general populace. It also remained the spoken tongue of the indigenous Assyrian/Babylonian citizens of all Mesopotamia under Persian, Greek and Roman rule, and indeed well into the [[Arab]] period it was still the language of the majority, particularly in the north of Mesopotamia, surviving to this day among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christians.

Between 150 BC and 226 AD, Assyria changed hands between the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] Iranians and Romans ([[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Province of Assyria]]) until coming under the rule of [[Sassanid]] Persia in 226–651 AD, where it was known as [[Asuristan]].

A number of at least partly neo-Assyrian kingdoms existed in the area between in the late classical and early Christian period also; [[Adiabene]], [[Hatra]] and [[Osroene]].

[[Mesopotamia in Classical literature|Classical historiographers]] and Biblical writers had only retained a fragmented, very dim and often inaccurate picture of Assyria. It was remembered that there had been an Assyrian empire predating the Persian one, but all particulars were lost. Thus Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' lists 36 kings of the Assyrians, beginning with [[Ninus]], son of [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], down to [[Sardanapalus]], the last king of the Assyrians before the empire fell to [[Arbaces]] the Median. Almost none of these have been substantiated as historical, with the exception of the Neo-Assyrian and Babylonian rulers listed in [[Ptolemy's Canon]], beginning with [[Nabonassar]].

Mesopotamian empires such as the Akkadian Empire, Babylonian Empire, Middle Assyrian Empire, Neo Assyrian Empire and Neo Babylonian Empire asserted Mesopotamian dominance from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to [[Arabia]] and [[Egypt]], and from [[Cyprus]] and the east [[Mediterranean]] to [[Persia]]. Thus the influence exerted by the Babylonian-Assyrian religion was particularly profound on other [[Semites]], including the [[Hebrews]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Canaanites]], [[Arameans]], [[Phoenicians]] and [[Arabs]], while their astral theology affected the ancient world in general, including the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]] and the later [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. The impetus to the purification of the old [[Semitic]] [[polytheistic religions]] to which the [[Hebrews]] for a long time clung in common with their fellows—the various branches of nomadic [[Arameans]] and [[Arabs]]—was largely furnished by the remarkable civilization unfolded in the Euphrates valley and in many of the traditions, myths and legends embodied in the Old Testament; traces of direct adaptation from and responses to Babylonia and Assyria may be discerned, while the indirect influences in the domain of the prophetical books, as also in the [[Psalms]] and in the so-called &quot;wisdom literature&quot;, are even more noteworthy. Stories in the [[Tanakh]], [[Old Testament]] and [[Quran]] such as; the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] [[creation narrative]], [[Tower of Babel]], [[The Great Flood]] and the book of [[Esther]], as well as various biblical characters such as [[Noah]], [[Nimrod]], [[Lilith]] and [[Asnapper]] bear clear influence from Assyria and Babylonia.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Jaynes (2000). The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Mariner Books. Retrieved 2013-06-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Contenau La Magie chez les Assyriens et les Babyloniens, Paris, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Stephen L. (2002). Understanding the Bible. McGraw-Hill. pp. 50–51.ISBN 9780767429160&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when we reach the [[New Testament]] period, we have not passed entirely beyond the sphere of Babylonian-Assyrian influences. In such a movement as early [[Christian]] [[gnosticism]], Assyrio-Babylonian elements—modified, to be sure, and transformed—are largely present, while the growth of an apocalyptic literature is ascribed with apparent justice by many scholars to the recrudescence of views, the ultimate source of which is to be found in the astral-theology of the Babylonian and Assyrian Priests.

The Assyrians began to form and adopt a distinct [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]], with its accompanying [[Syriac literature]], between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, however native religion was still alive and well into the 4th century AD, and pockets survived into the 10th century AD and possibly as late as the 17th century in Mardin. However, the religion is now dead, and the indigenous Assyrian (a.k.a. Chaldo-Assyrian) people, though still retaining Eastern Aramaic dialects as a mother tongue, are now wholly Christian.

The [[modern discovery of Babylonia and Assyria]] begins with excavations in [[Nineveh]] in 1845, which revealed the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]]. Decipherment of [[cuneiform]] was a formidable task that took more than a decade; but, by 1857, the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] was convinced that reliable reading of cuneiform texts was possible. [[Assyriology]] has since pieced together the formerly largely forgotten history of Mesopotamia. In the wake of the archaeological and philological [[rediscovery of ancient Assyria]], [[Assyrian nationalism]] became increasingly popular among the surviving remnants of the [[Assyrian people]], and has come to strongly identify with ancient Assyria.

==Old Testament characters==
===Women===
*[[Abijah (queen)]], (2 [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 29:1), who married King [[Ahaz]] of Judah. She is also called Abi. (2 [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 18:2) Her father's name was Zechariah; she was the mother of King [[Hezekiah]] ([[BibleWiki:2 Chronicles Chapter 29, Verse 1|2 Chr. 29:1]]).
*A wife of [[Hezron|Hetzron]], one of the grandchildren of [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] (1 Chr. 2:24).

===Men===
*[[Abijah (king)]] of the [[Kingdom of Judah]], also known as [[Abijam]] (אבים '' 'aḄiYaM'' &quot;My Father is Yam [Sea]&quot;), who was son of [[Rehoboam]] and succeeded him on the throne of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (1 Chr. 3:10, [[BibleWiki:Matthew Chapter 1, Verse 7|Matthew 1:7]], 1 Kings 14:31).
*A son of [[List of minor Biblical figures#Becher|Becher]], the son of [[Benjamin]] (1 Chr. 7:8).
*The second son of [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] ([[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 8:2; 1 Chr. 6:28). His conduct, along with that of his brother, as a judge in [[Beer-sheba]], to which office his father had appointed him, led to popular discontent, and ultimately provoked the people to demand a [[monarchy]].
*A descendant of [[Eleazar]], the son of [[Aaron]], a chief of one of the twenty-four orders into which the priesthood was divided by [[David (biblical king)|David]] (1 Chr. 24:10). The order of Abijah was one of those that did not return from the Captivity ([[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 2:36–39; [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 7:39–42; 12:1).
*A son of [[Jeroboam]], the first king of Israel. On account of his severe illness when a youth, his father sent his wife to consult the prophet [[Ahijah the Shilonite|Ahijah]] regarding his recovery. The prophet, though blind with old age, knew the wife of Jeroboam as soon as she approached, and under a divine impulse he announced to her that inasmuch as in Abijah alone of all the house of Jeroboam there was found &quot;some good thing toward the Lord&quot;, he only would come to his grave in peace. As his mother crossed the threshold of the door on her return, the youth died, and &quot;all Israel mourned for him&quot; ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 14:1–18).
*The head of the eighth of the twenty-four courses into which [[David]] divided the priests, and an ancestor of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zecharias]] the priest, who was the father of [[John the Baptist]] ({{bibleref|1Chronicles|24:10|KJV}}, {{bibleref|Luke|1:5|KJV}}, {{bibleref|Luke|1:13|KJV}}).
