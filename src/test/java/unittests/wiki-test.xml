'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] that advocates [[stateless society|stateless societies]] often defined as [[self-governance|self-governed]] voluntary institutions,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;ANARCHISM, a social philosophy that rejects authoritarian government and maintains that voluntary institutions are best suited to express man's natural social tendencies.&quot; George Woodcock. &quot;Anarchism&quot; at The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In a society developed on these lines, the voluntary associations which already now begin to cover all the fields of human activity would take a still greater extension so as to substitute themselves for the state in all its functions.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin___Anarchism__from_the_Encyclopaedia_Britannica.html Peter Kropotkin. &quot;Anarchism&quot; from the Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchism.&quot; The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. p. 14 &quot;Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. Anarchism, London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non-[[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state.&quot; Judith Suissa. ''Anarchism and Education: a Philosophical Perspective''. Routledge. New York. 2006. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iaf-ifa.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;That is why Anarchy, when it works to destroy authority in all its aspects, when it demands the abrogation of laws and the abolition of the mechanism that serves to impose them, when it refuses all hierarchical organisation and preaches free agreement — at the same time strives to maintain and enlarge the precious kernel of social customs without which no human or animal society can exist.&quot; [[Peter Kropotkin]]. [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Anarchism__its_philosophy_and_ideal.html Anarchism: its philosophy and ideal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;anarchists are opposed to irrational (e.g., illegitimate) authority, in other words, hierarchy — hierarchy being the institutionalisation of authority within a society.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/The_Anarchist_FAQ_Editorial_Collective__An_Anarchist_FAQ__03_17_.html#toc2 &quot;B.1 Why are anarchists against authority and hierarchy?&quot;] in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchism holds the [[state (polity)|state]] to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful.&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;

There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and State; careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy, class, and State interchangeably, as many social theorists do, is insidious and obscurantist. This practice, in the name of a &quot;classless&quot; or &quot;libertarian&quot; society, could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility, both of which-even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom.&quot; [[Murray Bookchin]]. ''The Ecology of Freedom: the emergence and dissolution of Hierarchy. CHESHIRE BOOKS
Palo Alto. 1982. Pg. 3''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Authority is defined in terms of the right to exercise social control (as explored in the &quot;sociology of power&quot;) and the correlative duty to obey (as explored in the &quot;philosophy of practical reason&quot;). Anarchism is distinguished, philosophically, by its scepticism towards such moral relations – by its questioning of the claims made for such normative power – and, practically, by its challenge to those &quot;authoritative&quot; powers which cannot justify their claims and which are therefore deemed illegitimate or without moral foundation.&quot;[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=kkj5i3CeGbQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Anarchism and Authority: A Philosophical Introduction to Classical Anarchism'' by Paul McLaughlin. AshGate. 2007. p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.&quot; [[Emma Goldman]]. &quot;What it Really Stands for Anarchy&quot; in ''[[Anarchism and Other Essays]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker defined anarchism as opposition to authority as follows &quot;They found that they must turn either to the right or to the left, – follow either the path of Authority or the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus were born State Socialism and Anarchism&amp;nbsp;... Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity.  representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.&quot; [[Benjamin Tucker]].

As an anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy.

==Etymology and terminology==
{{Related articles|Anarchist terminology}}

The term ''[[wikt:anarchism|anarchism]]'' is a compound word composed from the word ''[[anarchy]]'' and the suffix ''[[-ism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=anarchism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Anarchism], [[Online etymology dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; themselves derived respectively from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἀναρχία}}, i.e. ''anarchy''&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)narxi/a|ἀναρχία|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anarchy Anarchy], [[Merriam-Webster]] online.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=anarchy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Anarchy], [[Online etymology dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; (from {{lang|grc|ἄναρχος}}, ''anarchos'', meaning &quot;one without rulers&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/narxos|ἄναρχος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[privative]] prefix [[privative alpha|ἀν]]- (''an-'', i.e. &quot;without&quot;) and {{lang|grc|ἀρχός}}, ''archos'', i.e. &quot;leader&quot;, &quot;ruler&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)rxo/s|ἀρχός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf.

First Known Use: 1539&quot; [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anarchy &quot;Anarchy&quot; at Merriam Webster dictionary online]&lt;/ref&gt;''Anarchist'' was the term adopted by [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] to attack those on the left whom he had used for his own ends during the French Revolution but was determined to get rid of, though among these &quot;anarchists&quot; there were few who exhibited the social revolt characteristics of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as [[William Godwin]] and [[Wilhelm Weitling]], but they did not use the word ''anarchist'' or ''anarchism'' in describing themselves or their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Anarchists |last=Joll |first=James |year=1964 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-03642-5 |pages=27–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s, and beginning in France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Short History of Anarchism |last=Nettlau |first=Max |authorlink=Max Nettlau |year=1996 |publisher=Freedom Press |isbn=0-900384-89-1 |page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''libertarianism'' has often been used as a synonym for anarchism&lt;ref&gt;&quot;At the end of the century in France, Sebastien Faure took up a word used in 1858 by one Joseph Dejacque to make it the title of a journal, Le Libertaire. Today the terms &quot;anarchist&quot; and &quot;libertarian&quot; have become interchangeable.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Anarchism__From_Theory_to_Practice.html#toc2 ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice''] [[Daniel Guérin]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Dean.

The French [[Renaissance humanism|renaissance]] political philosopher [[Étienne de La Boétie]] wrote in his most famous work the ''Discourse on Voluntary Servitude'' what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent.&lt;ref&gt;Several historians of anarchism have gone so far as to classify La Botie's treatise itself as anarchist, which is incorrect since La botie never extended his analysis from tyrannical government to government per se. But while La Botie cannot be considered an anarchist, his sweeping strictures on tyranny and the universality of his political philosophy lend themselves easily to such an expansion.[http://books.google.com.ec/books?id=6o-8P3iqf7IC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=anarchism+la+boetie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z79GU1rW1t&amp;sig=4ini7oZUie2U8-P0BpMLogXYWPs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eAOFUJCYJ4Le9AT_iYG4DA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=anarchism%20la%20boetie&amp;f=false ''Introduction to The Politics of Obedience: The Discourse of Voluntary Servitude'' by Murray Rothbard. Ludwig Von Mises Institute. p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Quite rightly, La Boëtie recognizes the potential for domination in any democracy: the democratic leader, elected by the people, becomes intoxicated with his own power and teeters increasingly towards tyranny. Indeed, we can see modern democracy itself as an instance of voluntary servitude on a mass scale. It is not so much that we participate in an illusion whereby we are deceived by elites into thinking we have a genuine say in decision-making. It is rather that democracy itself has encouraged a mass contentment with powerlessness and a general love of submission.&quot;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/saul-newman-voluntary-servitude-reconsidered-radical-politics-and-the-problem-of-self-dominatio &quot;Voluntary Servitude Reconsidered: Radical Politics and the Problem of Self-Domination&quot;] [[Saul Newman]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The radical [[Protestant Christianity|Protestant Christian]] [[Gerrard Winstanley]] and his group the [[Diggers]] are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchists have regarded the secular revolt of the Diggers, or True Levellers, in seventeenth-century England led by Gerrard Winstanley as a source of pride. Winstanley, deeming that property is corrupting, opposed clericalism, political power and privilege. It is economic inequality, he believed, that produces crime and misery. He championed a primitive communalism based on the pure teachings of God as comprehended through reason.&quot; [http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Kenneth_C._Wenzer__Godwin_s_Place_in_the_Anarchist_Tradition___a_Bicentennial_Tribute.html Kenneth C. Wenzer. &quot;Godwin's Place in the Anarchist Tradition — a Bicentennial Tribute&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It was in these conditions of class struggle that, among a whole cluster of radical groups such as the Fifth Monarchy Men, the [[Levellers]] and the Ranters, there emerged perhaps the first real proto-anarchists, the Diggers, who like the classical 19th century anarchists identified political and economic power and who believed that a social, rather than political revolution was necessary for the establishment of justice. Gerrard Winstanley, the Diggers' leader, made an identification with the word of God and the principle of reason, an equivalent philosophy to that found in [[Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God is Within You]]''.&quot; Marlow. &quot;Anarchism and Christianity&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Although Proudhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first was Gerrard Winstanley (1609 – c. 1660), a linen draper who led the small movement of the Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the Civil War and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model Army seemed intent on preserving. In 1649–1650 the Diggers squatted on stretches of common land in southern England and attempted to set up communities based on work on the land and the sharing of goods.&quot; George Woodcock Anarchism The Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;anarchist&quot; first entered the English language in 1642, during the [[English Civil War]], as a [[Pejorative|term of abuse]], used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] against their [[Roundhead]] opponents.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml &quot;Anarchism&quot;], [[BBC Radio 4]] program, [[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]], Thursday 7 December 2006.

As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the [[French Revolution]], [[William Godwin]] developed the first expression of [[anarchist schools of thought|modern anarchist thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Everhart, Robert B 1982. p. 115&quot;&gt;Everhart, Robert B. The Public School Monopoly: A Critical Analysis of Education and the State in American Society. Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, 1982. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt; Godwin was, according to [[Peter Kropotkin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot; /&gt; while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early [[Edmund Burke]].&lt;ref&gt;Godwin himself attributed the first anarchist writing to [[Edmund Burke]]'s '' [[A Vindication of Natural Society]]''. &quot;Most of the above arguments may be found much more at large in Burke's ''Vindication of Natural Society''; a treatise in which the evils of the existing political institutions are displayed with incomparable force of reasoning and lustre of eloquence&amp;nbsp;...&quot; – footnote, Ch. 2 ''[[Political Justice]]'' by William Godwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|left|thumb|[[William Godwin]], &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;/&gt;]]
Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. He argued in ''[[Political Justice]]'' (1793)&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, Ian 2001. p. 116&quot;&gt;Adams, Ian. Political Ideology Today. Manchester University Press, 2001. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|godwin|William Godwin|Mark Philip|2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J. Robinson |oclc=2340417 |origyear=1793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people’s ‘mental enslavement’, the foundations of law, [[property rights]] and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.

The French [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] is regarded as the first ''self-proclaimed'' anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, ''[[What is Property?]],'' published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the theory of [[spontaneous order]] in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, &quot;Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order.&quot; In ''What is Property?'' Proudhon answers with the famous accusation &quot;[[Property is theft]].&quot; In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed &quot;property&quot; (''propriété''), where owners have complete rights to &quot;use and abuse&quot; their property as they wish.&lt;ref name=&quot;proudhon-prop&quot;&gt;[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]], Pierre-Joseph. ''&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/property/ch03.htm Chapter 3. Labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property]&quot;'' from ''&quot;[[What is Property?]]&quot;'', 1840&lt;/ref&gt; He contrasted this with what he called &quot;possession,&quot; or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. Later, however, Proudhon added that &quot;Property is Liberty,&quot; and argued that it was a bulwark against state power.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Stewart. Introduction to ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', Anchor Books, Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. 1969, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.

In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]], during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Breunig |first=Charles |title=The Age of Revolution and Reaction, 1789–1850 |year=1977 |publisher=[[W.

According to [[George Woodcock]] &quot;These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;George Woodcock.

One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], where Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.&lt;ref name=Graham-05&gt;Graham, Robert '[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm ''Anarchism''] (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1-55164-251-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paris Commune]] was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included {{quote|[[Louise Michel]], the Reclus brothers, and [[Eugene Varlin]] (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised&amp;nbsp;... Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the &quot;implementation of the binding mandate&quot; in 1848&amp;nbsp;... and for federation of communes). Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/commune.html|title=The Paris Commune|work=blackened.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} George Woodcock states:

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organisation of labour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas'', Vol. 1, p. 100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, the [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] would become standard.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt;

In response, unions across the United States prepared a [[general strike]] in support of the event.&lt;ref name=foner/&gt; On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when [[strikebreaker]]s attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |first=Paul |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |year=1984 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=0-691-00600-8 |page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Avrich |title=The Haymarket Tragedy |page=193 |isbn=0-691-04711-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.odmp.org/officer/3972-patrolman-mathias-j.-degan |title=Patrolman Mathias J.

The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the [[Haymarket affair]], and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foner |title=May Day |page=42 |isbn=0-7178-0624-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of [[International Workers' Day]] on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.&lt;ref name=foner&gt;{{cite book | last = Foner | first = Philip Sheldon | title = May day: a short history of the international workers' holiday, 1886–1986 | publisher = International Publishers | location = New York | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-7178-0624-3 |page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], and [[Christiaan Cornelissen]]. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[antimilitarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a [[social revolution]], while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that the trade-union movement was [[reformism|reformist]] and even [[Conservatism|conservative]], citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Skirda | first = Alexandre | title = [[Facing the Enemy|Facing the enemy: a history of anarchist organization from Proudhon to May 1968]] | publisher = [[A.

The [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|Spanish Workers Federation]] in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58&amp;nbsp;million members at one point and playing a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNT was affiliated with the [[International Workers Association]], a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular &quot;The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in [[Anarchism in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Anarchism in Brazil|Brazil]], Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was
undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organizations was the [[Federación Obrera Regional Argentina]]&amp;nbsp;... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anarchism 1962&quot;/&gt;

===Propaganda of the deed and illegalism===
{{Main|Propaganda of the deed|Illegalism|Expropriative anarchism}}
[[File:Lugi Gallean2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Italian-American]] anarchist [[Luigi Galleani]]. His followers, known as Galleanists, carried out a series of bombings and assassination attempts from 1914 to 1932 in what they saw as attacks on 'tyrants' and 'enemies of the people']]
Some anarchists, such as [[Johann Most]], advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because &quot;we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bright/most/actionprop.html |title=&quot;Action as Propaganda&quot; by Johann Most, 25 July 1885 |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date=21 April 2003 |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, &quot;propaganda of the deed&quot; to refer to individual bombings, [[regicide]]s, and [[tyrannicide]]s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal '[[Confiscation|expropriations]]'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20090312022528 |url=http://www.zabalaza.net/theory/txt_anok_comm_ap.htm |title=&quot;Anarchist-Communism&quot; by Alain Pengam }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illegalism]] as a practice emerged and within it &quot;The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins (&quot;[[propaganda by the deed]]&quot;) and the anarchist burglars (&quot;[[individual reappropriation]]&quot;) expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be ''exemplary'' invitations to revolt.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;illegalism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recollectionbooks.com/siml/library/illegalistsDougImrie.htm|title=The Illegalists - By Doug Imrie|work=recollectionbooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; France's [[Bonnot Gang]] was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. [[Peter Kropotkin]] thus wrote that year in ''Le Révolté'' that &quot;a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Billington, James H. 1998. ''Fire in the minds of men: origins of the revolutionary faith'' New Jersey: Transaction Books, p 417.&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the [[trade union]] movement. The [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]], [[Fernand Pelloutier]], argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without &quot;the individual dynamiter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm |title=Table Of Contents |publisher=Blackrosebooks.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Political repression|State repression]] (including the infamous 1894 French ''[[lois scélérates]]'') of the anarchist and [[labour movement]]s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French [[socialist movement]], into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 [[Paris Commune]], the execution and exile of many ''[[communards]]'' to [[penal colonies]], favoured individualist political expression and acts.&lt;ref&gt;Historian [[Benedict Anderson]] thus writes: &lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;In March 1871 the Commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months. Then [[Adolphe Thiers|Versailles]] seized the moment to attack and, in one horrifying week, executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, a number higher than those killed in the recent war or during [[Robespierre]]'s '[[Reign of Terror|Terror]]' of 1793–1794. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia. Thousands of others fled to Belgium, England, Italy, Spain and the United States. In 1872, stringent laws were passed that ruled out all possibilities of organising on the left. Not till 1880 was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned Communards. Meanwhile, the Third Republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napoleon]]'s imperialist expansion – in Indochina, Africa, and Oceania. Many of France's leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the Commune ([[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] was its quasi-minister of culture, [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Pissarro]] were active propagandists) or were sympathetic to it. The ferocious repression of 1871 and thereafter, was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the Third Republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad.&quot; (in {{cite news |author=Benedict Anderson |title=In the World-Shadow of Bismarck and Nobel |publisher=[[New Left Review]]|date=July–August 2004|url=http://newleftreview.org/?view=2519}}) &lt;/blockquote&gt; According to some analysts, in [[History of Germany since 1945|post-war Germany]], the prohibition of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] (KDP) and thus of institutional far-left political organisation may also, in the same manner, have played a role in the creation of the [[Red Army Faction]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]], President [[Marie François Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] of France, [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]], King [[Umberto I of Italy]], President [[William McKinley]] of the United States, King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and King [[George I of Greece]]. McKinley's assassin [[Leon Czolgosz]] claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and [[feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]]. Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because [[international terrorism]] arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite. The image of the anarchist throwing a bomb remains to this day.

Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914–1918) and the [[1917 October Revolution]].

===Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s===
{{Main|Anarchism in Russia|Russian Revolution (1917)|Revolutions of 1917–23}}
[[File:Makhno group.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nestor Makhno]] with members of the anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]]]
Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolshevik]]s in both [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution|October revolutions]], and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dirlik | first = Arif | title = Anarchism in the Chinese Revolution | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1991 | isbn = 0-520-07297-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]], which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Avrich | first = Paul | title = The Russian Anarchists | publisher = AK Press | location = Stirling | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-904859-48-8 |page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, in the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Free Territory]], they fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against the [[White movement|Whites]] (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt uprising]], before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new &quot;socialist&quot; Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.&lt;ref name=&quot;bakuninmarx&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]&quot; in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldman | first = Emma | title = [[My Disillusionment in Russia]] |chapter=Preface |page=xx | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-486-43270-X |quote= My critic further charged me with believing that &quot;had the Russians made the Revolution à la Bakunin instead of à la Marx&quot; the result would have been different and more satisfactory. I plead guilty to the charge. In truth, I not only believe so; I am certain of it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT]] and [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] left the organisations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last = Drachkovitch | editor1-first = Milorad M. |first=Max |last=Nomad |contribution=The Anarchist Tradition |title = Revolutionary Internationals 1864 1943 | publisher = Stanford University Press |page=88 | year = 1966 | isbn = 0-8047-0293-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revolutions of 1917–23|revolutionary wave of 1917–23]] saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]] which established the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] the anarchists [[Gustav Landauer]], [[Silvio Gesell]] and [[Erich Mühsam]] had important leadership positions within the revolutionary [[Council communism|councilist]] structures.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Munich Soviet (or &quot;Council Republic&quot;) of 1919 exhibited certain features of the TAZ, even though — like most revolutions — its stated goals were not exactly &quot;temporary.&quot; Gustav Landauer's participation as Minister of Culture along with Silvio Gesell as Minister of Economics and other anti-authoritarian and extreme libertarian socialists such as the poet/playwrights Erich Mühsam and Ernst Toller, and Ret Marut (the novelist B. Traven), gave the Soviet a distinct anarchist flavor.&quot; [[Hakim Bey]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the ''[[Platformism|Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)]]'',&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{cite book |last=Dielo Trouda |authorlink=Dielo Truda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 |accessdate=24 October 2006 |year=2006 |publisher=FdCA |location=Italy| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070311013533/http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000| archivedate= 11 March 2007&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; was supported.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of [[Parma]] in August 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 &quot;Daring but Divided&quot;] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The veteran Italian anarchist, [[Luigi Fabbri]], was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as &quot;the preventive counter-revolution.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;wordpress&quot;/&gt; In France, where the [[far right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[6 February 1934 crisis|February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a [[united front]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David. &quot;Fascism or Revolution.&quot; ''Le Libertaire''.

In Germany the anarchist [[Erich Mühsam]] was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the [[Reichstag fire]] in Berlin. [[Joseph Goebbels]], the Nazi [[Propagandaministerium|propaganda minister]], labelled him as one of &quot;those Jewish subversives.&quot; Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at [[Sonnenburg]], Brandenburg and finally, [[Oranienburg]]. On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] at [[Oranienburg concentration camp|Oranienburg]] when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.&lt;ref name=&quot; Shepherd&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Mühsam|first=Erich|editor=David A.

{{Main|Spanish Revolution}}
In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' [[social revolution]] that began during the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist]] and more broadly [[libertarian socialist]] organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily [[Catalonia]], [[Anarchist Aragon|Aragon]], [[Andalusia]], and parts of [[Levante, Spain|the Levante]]. Much of [[Spain's economy]] was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like [[Catalonia]], the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] influence, as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-allied party actively resisted attempts at [[collectivization]] enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, [[agriculture|agrarian]] areas became collectivised and run as [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] [[commune (intentional community)|communes]]. Anarchist historian [[Sam Dolgoff]] estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution,&lt;ref name=Dolgoff1974&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Paul Goodman.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], influential American anarchist author of ''[[Growing Up Absurd|Growing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized Society]]'' among other works critical of contemporary societies.]] Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between [[synthesis anarchism]] and [[platformism]] took importance once again especially in the [[Anarchism in Italy#Postwar years and today|anarchist movements of Italy]] and [[Anarchism in France#The Fourth Republic (1945–1958)|France]].

The guarantees of the 1940 Constitution permitted them to legally create an organization of this type, and it was thus that they agreed to dissolve the two principal Cuban anarchist organizations, the SIA and FGAC, and create a new, unified group, the Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (ALC), a sizable organization with a membership in the thousands.&quot;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Frank_Fernandez__Cuban_Anarchism__The_History_of_A_Movement.html#toc8 ''Cuban Anarchism: The History of A Movement'' by Frank Fernandez]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;robertgraham.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/|title=Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas, Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939-1977)|work=Robert Graham's Anarchism Weblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 in [[Anarchism in France|France]] the [[Fédération Anarchiste]] and the anarchosyndicalist trade union [[Confédération nationale du travail]] was established in the next year while the also [[Synthesist anarchism|synthesist]] [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana]] was founded in [[Anarchism in Italy|Italy]].

[[Anarcho-pacifism]] became influential in the [[Anti-nuclear movement]] and [[anti war movement]]s of the time&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the forties and fifties, anarchism, in fact if not in name, began to reappear, often in alliance with pacifism, as the basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the Cold War.[http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchism-a-documentary-history-of-libertarian-ideas-volume-two-the-emergence-of-the-new-anarchism-1939-1977/] The anarchist/pacifist wing of the peace movement was small in comparison with the wing of the movement that emphasized electoral work, but made an important contribution to the movement as a whole. Where the more conventional wing of the peace movement rejected militarism and war under all but the most dire circumstances, the anarchist/pacifist wing rejected these on principle.&quot;[http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm &quot;Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement&quot; by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the 1950s and 1960s anarcho-pacifism began to gel, tough-minded anarchists adding to the mixture their critique of the state, and tender-minded pacifists their critique of violence.

He explains that their pacifism, anarchism, and commitment to the downtrodden were one of the important models and inspirations for the 1960s. As Farrell puts it, &quot;Catholic Workers identified the issues of the sixties before the Sixties began, and they offered models of protest long before the protest decade.&quot;[http://library.nothingness.org/articles/SA/en/display/268 &quot;The Spirit of the Sixties: The Making of Postwar Radicalism&quot; by James J.

But the movements of the sixties were driven by concerns that were more compatible with an expressive style of politics, with hostility to authority in general and state power in particular&amp;nbsp;... By the late sixties, political protest was intertwined with cultural radicalism based on a critique of all authority and all hierarchies of power. Anarchism circulated within the movement along with other radical ideologies. The influence of anarchism was strongest among radical feminists, in the commune movement, and probably in the Weather Underground and elsewhere in the violent fringe of the anti-war movement.&quot; [http://www.monthlyreview.org/0901epstein.htm &quot;Anarchism and the Anti-Globalization Movement&quot; by Barbara Epstein]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 in [[Carrara]], Italy the [[International of Anarchist Federations]] was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the [[Fédération anarchiste|Fédération Anarchiste]]), the [[Federazione Anarchica Italiana]] of Italy and the [[Iberian Anarchist Federation]] as well as the [[Bulgaria]]n federation in French exile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/l/10760196.php London Federation of Anarchists involvement in Carrara conference, 1968] International Institute of Social History.

&lt;/ref&gt; a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of [[anarcha-feminism]], they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. Anarchist anthropologist [[David Graeber]] and anarchist historian [[Andrej Grubacic]] have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those &quot;who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits&quot; of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are &quot;much more informed, among other elements, by [[Traditional knowledge|indigenous]], [[feminism|feminist]], ecological and [[counterculture|cultural-critical]] ideas&quot;, and who by the turn of the 21st century formed &quot;by far the majority&quot; of anarchists.&lt;ref name=&quot;graeber&quot;&gt;[[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]], &quot;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796 Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century]&quot;, [[ZNet]].

Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as ''[[black bloc]]s''; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include [[security culture]], [[affinity groups]] and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet.&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; A significant event of this period was the confrontations at [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|WTO conference in Seattle in 1999]].&lt;ref name=rupert/&gt; According to anarchist scholar [[Simon Critchley]], &quot;contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary [[neo-liberalism]]&amp;nbsp;... One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Critchley#Infinitely Demanding|Infinitely Demanding]]'' by [[Simon Critchley]].

International anarchist federations in existence include the [[International of Anarchist Federations]], the [[International Workers' Association]], and [[International Libertarian Solidarity]].
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993–2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]] and the [[Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation]]; the CNT-AIT in France;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html%20Website%20of%20the%20Confédération%20Nationale%20du%20Travail%20-%20Association%20Internationale%20des%20Travailleurs http://www.cnt-ait-fr.org/CNT-AIT/ACCUEIL.html Website of the Confédération Nationale du Travail – Association Internationale des Travailleurs]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana|Union Sindicale Italiana]] in Italy; in the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]]  and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]] and [[Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland)|Anarchist Federation]].

{{Main|Anarchist schools of thought}}
[[File:Portrait of Pierre Joseph Proudhon 1865.jpg|thumb|Portrait of philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) by [[Gustave Courbet]]. Proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]], and influenced many later [[individualist anarchist]] and social anarchist thinkers.]]
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, [[individualist anarchism]] and [[social anarchism]], which have some different origins, values and evolution.&lt;ref name=slevin/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;black dict&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertarian-labyrinth.org/archive/Anarchism Anarchism], [http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1855069954 The New Encyclopedia of Social Reform] (1908).&lt;/ref&gt; The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises [[negative liberty]], i.e. opposition to state or [[social control]] over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise [[positive liberty]] to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, &quot;recognizing equality of entitlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Kevin and Boyd, Tony. ''Understanding Political Ideas and Movements''. Manchester University Press 2003, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical – those created throughout the 19th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-20th century and after.

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is [[philosophical anarchism]], which embodies the theoretical stance that the [[state (polity)|state]] lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William &amp; Tourain, Alain (Eds.). (2003). Anarchism. The Blackwell Dictionary of Modern Social Thought (2nd Edition, p. 12).

(Mar., 1986), pp. 300–02.&lt;/ref&gt; philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a [[minarchism|minimal state]] as unfortunate, and usually temporary, &quot;necessary evil&quot; but argue that citizens do not have a [[moral obligation]] to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Klosko, George. ''Political Obligations''. Oxford University Press 2005. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was &quot;[[anarchism without adjectives]]&quot;, a call for [[toleration]] first adopted by [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]] in 1889 in response to the &quot;bitter debates&quot; of anarchist theory at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''[[Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America]]''. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the [[anti-authoritarian]] beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard &quot;Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868–1898&quot; [p. 135].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical anarchist schools of thought===

====Mutualism====
{{Main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A member of a community,&quot; ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticised [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to a dissident Owenite, possibly from the Friendly Association for Mutual Interests of Valley Forge; [[Shawn Wilburn|Wilbur, Shawn]], 2006, &quot;More from the 1826 &quot;Mutualist&quot;?&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Proudhon proposed [[spontaneous order]], whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; where order arises when everybody does &quot;what he wishes and only what he wishes&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and where &quot;business transactions alone produce the social order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Proudhon |first=Pierre-Joseph |authorlink=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon |title=The Principle of Federation |publisher=University of Toronto Press |location=Toronto |year=1979 |isbn=0-8020-5458-7 |quote=The notion of ''anarchy'' in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist [[William Batchelder Greene]], each worker in the mutualist system would receive &quot;just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Communism versus Mutualism&quot;, ''Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments''. (Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875) [[William Batchelder Greene]]: &quot;Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul.

====Individualist anarchism====
{{Main|Individualist anarchism}}
{{Individualism sidebar}}
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the [[individual]] and their [[will (philosophy)|will]] over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;ryner&quot;&gt;&quot;What do I mean by individualism?
I mean by individualism the moral doctrine which, relying on no dogma, no tradition, no external determination, appeals only to the individual conscience.&quot;[http://www.marx.org/archive/ryner/1905/mini-manual.htm ''Mini-Manual of Individualism'' by Han Ryner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker&quot;&gt;&quot;I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself.&quot;&quot;Anarchism and the State&quot; in ''Individual Liberty''&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

In 1793, [[William Godwin]], who has often&lt;ref name=&quot;Everhart, Robert B 1982. p. 115&quot;/&gt; been cited as the first anarchist, wrote ''[[Political Justice]]'', which some consider the first expression of anarchism.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, Ian 2001. p. 116&quot;/&gt; Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a [[rationalist]] and [[utilitarian]] basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a [[Limited government|minimal state]] as a present &quot;necessary evil&quot; that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;godwinsep&quot;&gt;{{sep entry|godwin|William Godwin|Mark Philip|2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Political Justice|Enquiry Concerning Political Justice and its Influence on Modern Morals and Manners]] |last=Godwin |first=William |authorlink=William Godwin |year=1796 |publisher=G.G. and J.

Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, [[Development criticism|development critic]], surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading [[transcendentalist]]. He is best known for his books ''[[Walden]]'', a reflection upon [[simple living]] in natural surroundings, and his essay, ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]'', an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later [[Benjamin Tucker]] fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''.

====Social anarchism====
{{Main|Social anarchism}}
{{Libertarian socialism}}
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or [[coercion]]. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;This does not mean that the majority thread within the anarchist movement is uncritical of individualist anarchism. Far from it! Social anarchists have argued that this influence of non-anarchist ideas means that while its &quot;criticism of the State is very searching, and [its] defence of the rights of the individual very powerful,&quot; like Spencer it &quot;opens&amp;nbsp;... the way for reconstituting under the heading of 'defence' all the functions of the State.&quot; [http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/secGint.html Section G – Is individualist anarchism capitalistic?] ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for [[personal property]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary.org&quot;&gt;&quot;The revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business. Personal possession remains only in the things you use.

This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or ''[[propaganda by the deed]]'', which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.&lt;ref name = &quot;Patsouras-p54&quot; /&gt;

However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism.

=====Anarcho-syndicalism=====
{{Main|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
[[File:Manifestación CNT Bilbao.jpg|thumb|left|May day demonstration of Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalist]] trade union [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in [[Bilbao]], Basque Country in 2010]]Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the [[trade union|labour movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Sorel, Georges. 'Political Theorists in Context' Routledge (2004) p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcho-syndicalists view [[trade union|labour unions]] as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the [[State (polity)|state]] with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' [[wikt:Solidarity|solidarity]], [[Direct action]] and [[Workers' self-management]]
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only [[direct action]] – that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rocker, Rudolf. 'Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice' AK Press (2004) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or &quot;business agents&quot;; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. [[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarcho-Syndicalism''. The [[International Workers Association]] is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] played and still plays a major role in the Spanish [[labour movement]]. It was also an important force in the [[Spanish Civil War]].

[[Anarcha-feminism]] (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with [[feminism]]. It generally views [[patriarchy]] as a manifestation of involuntary [[Coercion|coercive]] hierarchy that should be replaced by [[decentralised]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free association]]. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of [[class struggle]], and the anarchist struggle against the [[State (polity)|state]]. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice-versa. [[L. Susan Brown]] claims that &quot;as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]].

[[Post-anarchism]] is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought, drawing from diverse ideas including [[post-modernism]], [[autonomist marxism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[Situationist International]], and [[postcolonialism]].

[[Left-wing market anarchism]] strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Writing before the rise of the Carson–Long school of left-libertarianism, historian of American anarchism David DeLeon was disinclined to treat any market-oriented variant of libertarianism as leftist; see DeLeon, David (1978).

Cp. Tucker, &quot;Socialism.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;But there has always been a market-oriented strand of libertarian socialism that emphasizes voluntary cooperation between producers. And markets, properly understood, have always been about cooperation. As a commenter at Reason magazine’s Hit&amp;Run blog, remarking on Jesse Walker’s link to the Kelly article, put it:  “every trade is a cooperative act.” In fact, it’s a fairly common observation among market anarchists that genuinely free markets have the most legitimate claim to the label “socialism.”&quot;.[http://c4ss.org/content/670 &quot;Socialism: A Perfectly Good Word Rehabilitated&quot;] by [[Kevin Carson]] at website of Center for a Stateless Society&lt;/ref&gt;

However Rothbard’s claim as an anarchist is quickly voided when it is shown that he only wants an end to the public state. In its place he allows countless private states, with each person supplying their own police force, army, and law, or else purchasing these services from capitalist venders...so what remains is shrill anti-statism conjoined to a vacuous freedom in hackneyed defense of capitalism. In sum, the “anarchy” of Libertarianism reduces to a liberal fraud.[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-sabatini-libertarianism-bogus-anarchy &quot;Libertarianism: Bogus Anarchy&quot; by Peter Sabatini] in issue #41 (Fall/Winter 1994–95) of ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchism is a [[philosophy]] that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]],&lt;ref name=oxcom&gt;&quot;Anarchism.&quot; ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]], and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[enlightened self-interest]], [[veganarchism|veganism]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative [[direct action]] methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, Carmen García Trevijano, [http://books.google.es/books?id=s9iwZGv44psC&amp;pg=PA402&amp;dq=Enciclopedia+teor%C3%ADa+pol%C3%ADtica&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA57,M1 ''Oxford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy''].&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].{{-}}

An important current within anarchism is [[free love]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ncc-1776&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html |title=The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy |publisher=Ncc-1776.org |date=1 December 1996 |accessdate=20 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101231195631/http://ncc-1776.org/tle1996/le961210.html| archivedate= 31 December 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to [[Josiah Warren]] and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's sovereignty. Free love particularly stressed [[women's rights]] since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; The most important American free love journal was ''[[Lucifer the Lightbearer]]'' (1883–1907) edited by [[Moses Harman]] and [[Lois Waisbrooker]],&lt;ref&gt;Joanne E. Passet, &quot;Power through Print: Lois Waisbrooker and Grassroots Feminism,&quot; in: ''Women in Print: Essays on the Print Culture of American Women from the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries'', James Philip Danky and Wayne A. Wiegand, eds., Madison, WI, University of Wisconsin Press, 2006; pp. 229–50.&lt;/ref&gt; but also there existed [[Ezra Heywood]] and Angela Heywood's ''[[The Word (free love)|The Word]]'' (1872–1890, 1892–1893).&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt; ''[[Free Society]]'' (1895–1897 as ''The Firebrand''; 1897–1904 as ''Free Society'') was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldman-MSF-551&quot;&gt;&quot;''Free Society'' was the principal English-language forum for anarchist ideas in the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century.&quot; ''Emma Goldman: Making Speech Free, 1902–1909'', p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication advocated [[free love]] and [[women's rights]], and critiqued &quot;[[Comstockery]]&quot; – censorship of sexual information. Also [[M. E. Lazarus]] was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.&lt;ref name=&quot;freelove&quot;/&gt;

In New York City's [[Greenwich Village]], [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Sochen, June. 1972. ''The New Woman: Feminism in Greenwich Village 1910–1920.'' New York: Quadrangle.&lt;/ref&gt; and the openly bisexual radical [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and the lesbian anarchist [[Margaret Anderson]] were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by [[Emma Goldman]], among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman &quot;has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jonathan Ned. ''Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.'' (New York: Thomas Y. Crowell, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, before Goldman, [[heterosexual]] anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal ''Der arme Teufel''. In Argentina anarcha-feminist [[Virginia Bolten]] published the newspaper called ''{{lang|es|La Voz de la Mujer}}'' (English: The Woman's Voice), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;molyneux&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Molyneux|first=Maxine|title=Women's movements in international perspective: Latin America and beyond|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2001|page=24|isbn=978-0-333-78677-2|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yg9HFrOG89kC&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was [[Emile Armand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iisg.nl/womhist/manfreuk.pdf |title=E. Armand and &quot;la camaraderie amoureuse&quot; – Revolutionary sexualism and the struggle against jealousy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed the concept of ''la camaraderie amoureuse'' to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of [[polyamory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;armandfreelove&quot;/&gt; In Germany the [[stirner]]ists [[Adolf Brand]] and [[John Henry Mackay]] were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male [[bisexuality]] and [[homosexuality]]. [[Mujeres Libres]] was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women. It was founded in 1936 by [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]], Mercedes Comaposada and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón]] and had approximately 30,000 members. The organisation was based on the idea of a &quot;double struggle&quot; for [[Feminist movement|women's liberation]] and [[social revolution]] and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws98/ws54_mujeres_libres.html Mujeres Libres – Women anarchists in the Spanish Revolution&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]] was a main founder of the Spanish [[anarcha-feminist]] federation [[Mujeres Libres]] who was open about her [[lesbian]]ism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wzar.unizar.es/siem/articulos/Premios/MujeresLibres.pdf &quot;basta pensar en el lesbianismo de Lucía Sánchez Saornil&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name, she was able to explore [[lesbian]] themes&lt;ref&gt;&quot;R. Fue una época transgresora, emergió el feminismo y la libertad sexual estuvo en el candelero. Hay rastreos de muchas lesbianas escritoras: Carmen Conde[primera académica de número], Victorina Durán, Margarita Xirgu, Ana María Sagi, la periodista Irene Polo, Lucía Sánchez Saornil, fundadora de Mujeres Libres[sección feminista de CNT]... Incluso existía un círculo sáfico en Madrid como lugar de encuentro y tertulia. P. ¿Se declaraban lesbianas? R. Había quien no se escondía mucho, como Polo o Durán, pero lesbiana era un insulto, algo innombrable. Excepto los poemas homosexuales de Sánchez Saornil, sus textos no eran explícitos para poder publicarlos, así que hay que reinterpretarlos.&quot;[http://elpais.com/diario/2007/12/06/paisvasco/1196973608_850215.html &quot;Tener referentes serios de lesbianas elimina estereotipos&quot; by Juan Fernandez at ''El Pais'']&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to [[censorship]] and punishment.

More recently, the British [[anarcho-pacifist]] [[Alex Comfort]] gained notoriety during the [[sexual revolution]] for writing the bestseller sex manual ''[[The Joy of Sex]]''. The issue of [[free love]] has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-[[hedonist]] philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] in such works as ''Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire'' (2000) and ''L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques'' (2002).

===Libertarian education and freethought===

His educational experiments, for example, possibly under the influence of the Swiss educational theorist [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] (via [[Robert Owen|Owen]]), emphasized – as we would expect – the nurturing of the independence and the conscience of individual children, not the inculcation of pre-conceived values.[http://www.crispinsartwell.com/warrenintrocurrent.htm &quot;Introduction of The Practical Anarchist: Writings of Josiah Warren&quot; by Crispin Sartwell]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Stirner]] wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called ''[[The False Principle of our Education]]''. In it Stirner names his educational principle &quot;personalist,&quot; explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create &quot;free men, sovereign characters,&quot; by which he means &quot;eternal characters&amp;nbsp;... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html |title=The False Principle of our Education|author=Max Stirner |publisher=Tmh.floonet.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States &quot;freethought was a basically [[Anti-Christianity|anti-christian]], [[anti-clerical]] movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]'' (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of ''Freethought'' and, for a time, ''The Truth Seeker''. E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]''&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt; &quot;Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as ''[[Lucifer, the Light-Bearer]]'', ''Freethought'' and ''The Truth Seeker'' appeared in ''[[Liberty (1881–1908)|Liberty]]''...&amp;nbsp;The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mises.org&quot;/&gt;

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and [[Freethought|free-thinker]] [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established &quot;modern&quot; or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geoffrey C. Fidler |date=Spring–Summer 1985 |title=The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: &quot;Por la Verdad y la Justicia&quot; |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=1/2 |pages=103–132   |doi=10.2307/368893 |jstor=368893 |publisher=History of Education Society |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools' stated goal was to &quot;[[Popular education|educate the working class]] in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting&quot;. Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in &quot;freedom in education&quot;, education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |title=Francisco Ferrer's Modern School |publisher=Flag.blackened.net |date= |accessdate=20 September 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html| archivedate= 7 August 2010&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Bookchin]] wrote: &quot;This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7, ''[[anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchosyndicalism]], The New Ferment''. In Murray Bookchin, ''The Spanish anarchists: the heroic years, 1868–1936''. AK Press, 1998, p. 115. ISBN 1-873176-04-X&lt;/ref&gt; La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of ''[[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]]'' in the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fidler&quot;/&gt; [[Cuba]], South America and London. The first of these was started in New York City in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901. Russian [[christian anarchist]] [[Leo Tolstoy]] established a school for peasant children on his estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot;&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Matt_Hern__The_Emergence_of_Compulsory_Schooling_and_Anarchist_Resistance.html &quot;The Emergence of Compulsory Schooling and Anarchist Resistance&quot; by Matt Hern]&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wilson | first = A.N. | title = Tolstoy | publisher = Norton, W. W. &amp; Company, Inc. | year = 2001 | page = xxi | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=imYmH8myBUsC&amp;pg=PR19 |  isbn = 0-393-32122-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot; /&gt; He thought that &quot;Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself&amp;nbsp;... Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot; /&gt; For him &quot;without compulsion, education was transformed into culture&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GroupedRef2&quot; /&gt;

A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of [[unschooling]] and the [[anarchist free school|free school]] in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Purkis | first = Jon | title = Changing Anarchism | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-7190-6694-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;British anarchists [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]] manifested that &quot;A.S. Neill is the modern pioneer of libertarian education and of &quot;hearts not heads in the school&quot;. Though he has denied being an anarchist, it would be hard to know how else to describe his philosophy, though he is correct in recognising the difference between revolution in philosophy and pedagogy, and the revolutionary change of society. They are associated but not the same thing.&quot; [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]]. [http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/stuart-christie-albert-meltzer-the-floodgates-of-anarchy  ''The Floodgates of Anarchy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent (2010) ''Modern Political Ideologies'', 3rd edition, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political [[class struggle]]-approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Judith |last=Suissa |url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1288/anarchy-in-the-classroom|title= Anarchy in the classroom |journal=[[The New Humanist]] |volume=120 |issue=5 |date=September–October 2005 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term [[deschooling]] was popularised by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Illich| first=Ivan |title=Deschooling Society |place= New York|publisher= Harper and Row| year= 1971| isbn= 0-06-012139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
{{Main|Criticisms of anarchism}}
Criticisms of anarchism include [[morality|moral]] criticisms and pragmatic criticisms. Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or [[utopian]] by its critics. European history professor Carl Landauer, in his book ''European Socialism'' argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a &quot;lesser evil&quot; than a society without &quot;repressive force.&quot; He also argued that &quot;ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears&quot; is an &quot;absurdity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Landauer, Carl. ''European Socialism: A History of Ideas and Movements'' (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Autism''' is a [[neurodevelopmental disorder]] characterized by impaired [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]], [[language acquisition|verbal]] and [[non-verbal communication]], and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; The signs typically develop gradually, but some children with autism will reach their [[developmental milestones]] at a normal pace and then [[Regressive autism|regress]].&lt;ref name=Stefanatos/&gt; 

&lt;!-- Causes and diagnosis --&gt;
Autism is highly heritable, but the cause includes both environmental factors and genetic susceptibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal |author=Goldani AA, Downs SR, Widjaja F, Lawton B, Hendren RL |title=Biomarkers in autism |journal=Front Psychiatry |volume=5  |pages=100 |year=2014 |pmid=25161627 |pmc=4129499 |doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2014.00100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with [[Teratology|agents that cause birth defects]].&lt;ref name=Arndt/&gt; [[Controversies in autism|Controversies]] surround other proposed environmental [[Causes of autism|causes]];&lt;ref name=Rutter/&gt; for example, the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and have been disproven in scientific studies. The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|diagnostic criteria]] require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{vcite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Autism Spectrum Disorder, 299.00 (F84.0) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pagex = 50–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autism affects information processing in the [[Human brain|brain]] by altering how nerve cells and their [[synapse]]s connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; It is one of three recognized disorders in the [[autism spectrum]] (ASDs), the other two being [[Asperger syndrome]], which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and [[PDD-NOS|pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified]] (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
[[Early intensive behavior intervention|Early behavioral]], cognitive, or speech interventions can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills.&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; Although there is no known cure,&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; there have been reported cases of children who recovered.&lt;ref name=Helt/&gt; Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howlin&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Howlin P, Goode S, Hutton J, Rutter M | title = Adult outcome for children with autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages = 212–29 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14982237 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.00215.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism|autistic culture]] has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be [[Autism rights movement|accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder]].&lt;ref name=Silverman/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
As of 2010 the rate of autism is estimated at about 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide, and it occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD {{as of|2014|lc=y}}, a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASD Data and Statistics&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |title = ASD Data and Statistics |website = CDC.gov |accessdate= 5 Apr 2014 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20140418153648/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |archivedate = 2014-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MMWR2012&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors =  | title = Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders&amp;nbsp;— autism and developmental disabilities monitoring network, 14 sites, United States, 2008 | journal = MMWR Surveill Summ | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–19 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22456193 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6103a1.htm | archivedate = 2014-03-25 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20140325235639/http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6103a1.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NHSR65&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Blumberg SJ, Bramlett MD, Kogan MD, Schieve LA, Jones JR, Lu MC | title = Changes in prevalence of parent-reported autism spectrum disorder in school-aged U.S. children: 2007 to 2011-2012 | journal = Natl Health Stat Report | volume = | issue = 65 | pages = 1–11 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24988818 | url = http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr065.pdf | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6JoG0uE7r|archivedate=2013-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%.&lt;ref name=NHSEstimating/&gt; The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses;&lt;ref name=&quot;NHSR65&quot;/&gt; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Autism is a highly variable [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]&lt;ref name=Geschwind/&gt; that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without [[Remission (medicine)|remission]].&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Rogers SJ | title = What are infant siblings teaching us about autism in infancy? | journal = Autism Res | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–37 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19582867 | pmc = 2791538 | doi = 10.1002/aur.81  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Filipek/&gt; Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.&lt;ref name=London/&gt;

===Social development===
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD; see [[#Classification|Classification]]) from other developmental disorders.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt; People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]] described her inability to understand the [[social communication]] of [[neurotypical]]s, or people with normal [[neural development]], as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |title=[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]: Seven Paradoxical Tales |author=[[Oliver Sacks|Sacks O]] |publisher=Knopf |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-679-43785-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood.&lt;!-- ref name=Volkmar/ --&gt; Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from [[social norms]]; for example, they have less [[eye contact]] and turn taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as the deficiency to point at things.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt; Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form [[Attachment (psychology)|attachments]] to their primary caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Dijamco A, Gratier M, Rozga A | title = Early detection of core deficits in autism | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 221–33 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15666338 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20046 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most childen with autism display moderately less [[Attachment in children#Secure attachment|attachment security]] than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Rutgers AH, Bakermans-Kranenburg MJ, van Ijzendoorn MH, van Berckelaer-Onnes IA | title = Autism and attachment: a meta-analytic review | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 1123–34 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15257669 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2004.t01-1-00305.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Older children and adults with ASD [[Face perception#Face perception in individuals with autism|perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sigman&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Sigman M, Spence SJ, Wang AT | title = Autism from developmental and neuropsychological perspectives | journal = Annu Rev Clin Psychol | volume = 2 | pages = 327–55 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17716073 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and [[tantrum]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Matson JL, Nebel-Schwalm M | title = Assessing challenging behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorders: A review | journal = Research in Developmental Disabilities | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 567–79 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 16973329 | doi = 10.1016/j.ridd.2006.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication===
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Noens I, van Berckelaer-Onnes I, Verpoorten R, van Duijn G | title = The ComFor: an instrument for the indication of augmentative communication in people with autism and intellectual disability | journal = J Intellect Disabil Res | volume = 50 | issue = 9 | pages = 621–32 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16901289 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2788.2006.00807.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of [[babbling]], unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words ([[echolalia]])&lt;ref name=Landa/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; or [[Pronoun reversal|reverse pronouns]].&lt;ref name=Kanner1943/&gt; [[Joint attention]] seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD:&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Johnson CP, Myers SM | title = Identification and evaluation of children with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 120 | issue = 5 | pages = 1183–215 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17967920 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2007-2361 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1183 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090208013449/http://pediatrics.aappublications.org:80/cgi/content/full/120/5/1183 | archivedate = 2009-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object,&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tager-Flusberg/&gt; and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Landa R | title = Early communication development and intervention for children with autism | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–25 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17326115 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tager-Flusberg&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tager-Flusberg H, Caronna E | title = Language disorders: autism and other pervasive developmental disorders | journal = Pediatr Clin North Am | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 469–81 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17543905 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2007.02.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.&lt;ref name=Williams/&gt;

===Repetitive behavior===
Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R)&lt;ref name=Lam-Aman/&gt; categorizes as follows.

[[File:Autistic-sweetiepie-boy-with-ducksinarow.jpg|thumb|alt=Young boy asleep on a bed, facing the camera, with only the head visible and the body off-camera. On the bed behind the boy's head is a dozen or so toys carefully arranged in a line.|A young boy with autism who has arranged his toys in a row]]
* '''[[Stereotypy]]''' is repetitive movement, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.
* '''[[Compulsive behavior]]''' is intended and appears to follow rules, such as arranging objects in stacks or lines.
* '''Sameness''' is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted.
* '''[[Ritual#Psychology|Ritualistic behavior]]''' involves an unvarying pattern of daily activities, such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual. This is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lam-Aman&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Lam KS, Aman MG | title = The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised: independent validation in individuals with autism spectrum disorders | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 855–66 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17048092 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-006-0213-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Restricted behavior''' is limited in focus, interest, or activity, such as preoccupation with a single television program, toy or game.
* '''[[Self-injury]]''' includes movements that injure or can injure the person, such as eye-poking, [[Dermatillomania|skin-picking]], hand-biting and head-banging.&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; 
No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Bodfish JW, Symons FJ, Parker DE, Lewis MH | title = Varieties of repetitive behavior in autism: comparisons to mental retardation | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 237–43 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11055459 | doi = 10.1023/A:1005596502855 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other symptoms===

The [[mirror neuron system]] (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions.&lt;ref&gt;MNS and autism:

From studies based on [[event-related potential]]s, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Jeste SS, Nelson CA | title = Event related potentials in the understanding of autism spectrum disorders: an analytical review | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–510 | year = 2009 | pmid = 18850262 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-008-0652-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[magnetoencephalography]] studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Roberts TP, Schmidt GL, Egeth M, Blaskey L, Rey MM, Edgar JC, Levy SE | title = Electrophysiological signatures: magnetoencephalographic studies of the neural correlates of language impairment in autism spectrum disorders | journal = Int J Psychophysiol | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–60 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18336941 | pmc = 2397446 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2008.01.012 | author. =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuropsychology===
Two major categories of [[cognitive]] theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in [[social cognition]]. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]]'s [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing.&lt;ref name=E-S-theory/&gt;  These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen's earlier [[theory of mind]] approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the [[Sally–Anne test]] for reasoning about others' motivations,&lt;ref name=&quot;E-S-theory&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S | title = Autism: the empathizing–systemizing (E-S) theory | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1156 | pages = 68–80 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19338503 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x | url = http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20131214134422/http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_BC_nyas.pdf | archivedate = 2013-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in ''[[#Pathophysiology|Pathophysiology]]'' maps well to the hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Iacoboni/&gt; However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Hamilton AF | title = Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 881–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19508497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the [[executive functions]] such as [[working memory]], planning, [[Inhibition Theory|inhibition]]. In his review, Kenworthy states that &quot;the claim of [[executive dysfunction]] as a causal factor in autism is controversial&quot;, however, &quot;it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kenworthy/&gt; Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Hearn K, Asato M, Ordaz S, Luna B | title = Neurodevelopment and executive function in autism | journal = Dev Psychopathol | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 1103–32 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18838033 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579408000527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Hill EL | title = Executive dysfunction in autism | journal = Trends Cogn Sci | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–32 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14697400 | doi = 10.1016/j.dr.2004.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenworthy&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kenworthy L, Yerys BE, Anthony LG, Wallace GL | title = Understanding executive control in autism spectrum disorders in the lab and in the real world | journal = Neuropsychol Rev | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 320–38 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18956239 | pmc = 2856078 | doi = 10.1007/s11065-008-9077-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism.&lt;ref name=Sigman/&gt;

[[Weak central coherence theory]] hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Happé F, Frith U | title = The weak coherence account: detail-focused cognitive style in autism spectrum disorders | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–25 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16450045 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-0039-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and [[perceptual]] operations in autistic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Mottron L, Dawson M, Soulières I, Hubert B, Burack J | title = Enhanced perceptual functioning in autism: an update, and eight principles of autistic perception | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–43 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16453071 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-0040-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.

Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties.&lt;ref name=&quot;HappeTime&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Happé F, Ronald A, Plomin R | title = Time to give up on a single explanation for autism | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 1218–20 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17001340 | doi = 10.1038/nn1770 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | journal = Dev Rev | year = 2007 | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 224–60 | title = Cognitive theories of autism | vauthors = Rajendran G, Mitchell P | doi = 10.1016/j.dr.2007.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or [[Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry and psychology|idiosyncratic language]], and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome]], [[intellectual disability]] or global developmental delay.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; [[ICD-10]] uses essentially the same definition.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICD-10-F84.0&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f84 |year=2007 |accessdate=10 October 2009|work=ICD-10: International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems: Tenth Revision|publisher=World Health Organization |title=F84.

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]] (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the [[Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule]] (ADOS)&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Gotham K, Risi S, Dawson G, Tager-Flusberg H, Joseph R, Carter A, Hepburn S, McMahon W, Rodier P, Hyman SL, Sigman M, Rogers S, Landa R, Spence MA, Osann K, Flodman P, Volkmar F, Hollander E, Buxbaum J, Pickles A, Lord C | title = A replication of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) revised algorithms | journal = J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 642–51 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18434924 | pmc = 3057666 | doi = 10.1097/CHI.0b013e31816bffb7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses observation and interaction with the child. The [[Childhood Autism Rating Scale]] (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.&lt;ref name=Volkmar/&gt;

A [[pediatrician]] commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated [[medical conditions]].&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; A pediatric [[neuropsychologist]] is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanne&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kanne SM, Randolph JK, Farmer JE | title = Diagnostic and assessment findings: a bridge to academic planning for children with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Neuropsychol Rev | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 367–84 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18855144 | doi = 10.1007/s11065-008-9072-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[differential diagnosis]] for ASD at this stage might also consider [[intellectual disability]], [[hearing impairment]], and a [[specific language impairment]]&lt;ref name=Dover/&gt; such as [[Landau–Kleffner syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Mantovani JF | title = Autistic regression and Landau–Kleffner syndrome: progress or confusion? | journal = Dev Med Child Neurol | volume = 42 | issue = 5 | pages = 349–53 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10855658 | doi = 10.1017/S0012162200210621 | title. =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Matson JL, Neal D | title = Cormorbidity: diagnosing comorbid psychiatric conditions | journal = Psychiatr Times | volume = 26 |issue=4 |year=2009|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1403043 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20130403062215/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/1403043 | archivedate = 2013-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clinical genetics]] evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Schaefer GB, Mendelsohn NJ | title = Genetics evaluation for the etiologic diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders | journal = Genet Med | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–12 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18197051 | doi = 10.1097/GIM.0b013e31815efdd7 | laysummary = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php | laydate = 7 February 2008 | laysource = Medical News Today }} {{Wayback|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/96448.php|date =20100901151333}}&lt;/ref&gt; consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and [[fragile X]] testing.&lt;ref name=Caronna/&gt; A [[Genotype-first approach|genotype-first]] model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ledbetter DH | title = Cytogenetic technology—genotype and phenotype | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 359 | issue = 16 | pages = 1728–30 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18784093 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMe0806570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge.

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Landa3&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Landa RJ | title = Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life | journal = Nat Clin Pract Neurol | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 138–47 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18253102 | doi = 10.1038/ncpneuro0731 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dover&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Dover CJ, Le Couteur A | title = How to diagnose autism | journal = Arch Dis Child | volume = 92 | issue = 6 | pages = 540–5 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17515625 | doi = 10.1136/adc.2005.086280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Shattuck PT, Grosse SD | title = Issues related to the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders | journal = Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 129–35 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17563895 | doi = 10.1002/mrdd.20143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the [[visually impaired]], partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or [[blindism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | title = Visual impairment and autism: current questions and future research | vauthors = Cass H |journal=Autism |year=1998 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=117–38|doi=10.1177/1362361398022002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
Autism is one of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior.&lt;ref name=ICD-10-F84.0/&gt; These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.&lt;ref name=Rapin/&gt;

Of the five PDD forms, [[Asperger syndrome]] is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; [[Rett syndrome]] and [[childhood disintegrative disorder]] share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; [[PDD not otherwise specified]] (PDD-NOS; also called ''atypical autism'') is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Volkmar FR, State M, Klin A | title = Autism and autism spectrum disorders: diagnostic issues for the coming decade | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 108–15 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19220594 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02010.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in [[language development]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-IV-TR-299.00&quot;&gt;{{vcite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV |chapter=Diagnostic criteria for 299.00 Autistic Disorder |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |edition=4 |location=Washington, DC|year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-89042-025-6 |oclc=768475353 |url=http://cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |accessdate=|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131029080544/http://www.cdc.gov:80/ncbddd/autism/hcp-dsm.html |archivedate=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the ''autism spectrum disorders'' (ASD)&lt;ref name=CCD/&gt; or sometimes the ''autistic disorders'',&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Freitag CM | title = The genetics of autistic disorders and its clinical relevance: a review of the literature | journal = Mol Psychiatry | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–22 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17033636 | doi = 10.1038/sj.mp.4001896 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas autism itself is often called ''autistic disorder'',''childhood autism'', or ''infantile autism''.

The manifestations of autism cover a wide [[Spectrum disorder|spectrum]], ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, [[developmentally disabled]], and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, [[pedantic]] communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Happé F | title = Understanding assets and deficits in autism: why success is more interesting than failure | journal = Psychologist | volume = 12 | issue = 11 | pages = 540–7 | year = 1999 | url = http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20120517162434/http://www.thepsychologist.org.uk/archive/archive_home.cfm/volumeID_12-editionID_46-ArticleID_133-getfile_getPDF/thepsychologist/psy_11_99_p540-547_happe.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary.&lt;ref name=Geschwind-2009/&gt; Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or [[high-functioning autism]] (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on [[IQ]] thresholds,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Baron-Cohen S | title = The hyper-systemizing, assortative mating theory of autism | journal = Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 865–72 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16519981 | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.010 | url = http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Neuropsychophamacology.pdf | format = PDF | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20120513020615/http://autismresearchcentre.com/docs/papers/2006_BC_Neuropsychophamacology.pdf | archivedate = 12 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial.

The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without.&lt;ref name=Newschaffer/&gt; Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed.&lt;ref name=Chaste/&gt;  Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Chaste/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Gardener H, Spiegelman D, Buka SL | title = Prenatal risk factors for autism: comprehensive meta-analysis | journal = Br J Psychiatry | volume = 195 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–14 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19567888 | pmc = 3712619 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.108.051672 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism.&lt;ref name=Geschwind-2009/&gt; Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Bertoglio K, Hendren RL | title = New developments in autism | journal = Psychiatr Clin North Am | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–14 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19248913 | doi = 10.1016/j.psc.2008.10.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other conditions are common in children with autism.&lt;ref name=Levy/&gt; They include:
* '''[[Genetic disorder]]s'''. About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable [[Mendelian]] (single-gene) condition, [[chromosome abnormality]], or other genetic syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Folstein SE, Rosen-Sheidley B | title = Genetics of autism: complex aetiology for a heterogeneous disorder | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 943–55 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11733747 | doi = 10.1038/35103559 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Zafeiriou DI, Ververi A, Vargiami E | title = Childhood autism and associated comorbidities | journal = Brain Dev | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 257–72 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17084999 | doi = 10.1016/j.braindev.2006.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Intellectual disability]]'''. The percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from 25% to 70%, a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing autistic intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter= Learning in autism |author= Dawson M, Mottron L, Gernsbacher MA |title= Learning and Memory: A Comprehensive Reference |volume=2 |pages=759–72 |editor= Byrne JH (ed.-in-chief), Roediger HL III (vol. ed.) |publisher= Academic Press |year=2008 |doi=10.1016/B978-012370509-9.00152-2 |isbn=978-0-12-370504-4 |chapterurl=http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |accessdate=26 July 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120303191513/http://psych.wisc.edu/lang/pdf/Dawson_AutisticLearning.pdf |archivedate= 3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, for PDD-NOS the association with intellectual disability is much weaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Chakrabarti S, Fombonne E | title = Pervasive developmental disorders in preschool children | journal = JAMA | volume = 285 | issue = 24 | pages = 3093–9 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11427137 | doi = 10.1001/jama.285.24.3093 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/285/24/3093 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100828195243/http://jama.ama-assn.org:80/cgi/content/full/285/24/3093 | archivedate = 2010-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by definition, the diagnosis of Asperger's excludes intellectual disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book | title=DSM-IV-TR Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition text revision | publisher=American Psychiatric Association, Washington DC | year=2000 | page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Anxiety disorder]]s''' are common among children with ASD; there are no firm data, but studies have reported prevalences ranging from 11% to 84%. Many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by ASD itself, or are hard to distinguish from ASD's symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = White SW, Oswald D, Ollendick T, Scahill L | title = Anxiety in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–29 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19223098 | pmc = 2692135 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.01.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Epilepsy]]''', with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age, cognitive level, and type of [[language disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Spence SJ, Schneider MT | title = The role of epilepsy and epileptiform EEGs in autism spectrum disorders | journal = Pediatr Res | volume = 65 | issue = 6 | pages = 599–606 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19454962 | pmc = 2692092 | doi = 10.1203/PDR.0b013e31819e7168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Several '''[[metabolic defect]]s''', such as [[phenylketonuria]], are associated with autistic symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manzi&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Manzi B, Loizzo AL, Giana G, Curatolo P | title = Autism and metabolic diseases | journal = J Child Neurol | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 307–14 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18079313 | doi = 10.1177/0883073807308698 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Minor physical anomalies]]''' are significantly increased in the autistic population.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ozgen HM, Hop JW, Hox JJ, Beemer FA, van Engeland H | title = Minor physical anomalies in autism: a meta-analysis | journal = Mol Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 300–7 | year = 2010 | pmid = 18626481 | doi = 10.1038/mp.2008.75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Preempted diagnoses'''. Although the DSM-IV rules out concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)]], [[Tourette syndrome]], and other of these conditions are often present and these [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders|comorbid diagnoses]] are increasingly accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Steyaert JG, De la Marche W | title = What's new in autism? | journal = Eur J Pediatr | volume = 167 | issue = 10 | pages = 1091–101 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18597114 | doi = 10.1007/s00431-008-0764-4 | title. =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sleep problems''' affect about two-thirds of individuals with ASD at some point in childhood. These most commonly include symptoms of [[insomnia]] such as difficulty in falling asleep, frequent [[middle-of-the-night insomnia|nocturnal awakenings]], and early morning awakenings. Sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress, and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary ASD diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Richdale AL, Schreck KA | title = Sleep problems in autism spectrum disorders: prevalence, nature, &amp; possible biopsychosocial aetiologies | journal = Sleep Med Rev | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 403–11 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19398354 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2009.02.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leo-Kanner.jpeg|thumb|upright|alt=Head and shoulders of a man in his early 60s in coat and tie, facing slightly to his right. He is balding and has a serious but slightly smiling expression.|[[Leo Kanner]] introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in 1943.]]
A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The ''[[Table Talk (Luther)|Table Talk]]'' of [[Martin Luther]], compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal |journal=Autism |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=13–23 |year=1997 |doi=10.1177/1362361397011004 |title=The history of ideas on autism: legends, myths and reality | vauthors = Wing L | author-link1 = Lorna Wing }}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Miles M |year=2005 |title=Martin Luther and childhood disability in 16th century Germany: what did he write? what did he say? |title.= |publisher=Independent Living Institute |url=http://www.independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html |accessdate=23 December 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131103210840/http://www.independentliving.org/docs7/miles2005b.html |archivedate=2013-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |author=Houston R, Frith U |title=Autism in History: The Case of Hugh Blair of Borgue |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-631-22089-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wild Boy of Aveyron]], a [[feral child]] caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student [[Jean Marc Gaspard Itard|Jean Itard]] treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wolff&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Wolff S | title = The history of autism | journal = Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 201–8 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15365889 | doi = 10.1007/s00787-004-0363-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Latin]] word ''autismus'' (English translation ''autism'') was coined by the [[Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of [[schizophrenia]]. He derived it from the Greek word ''autós'' (αὐτός, meaning &quot;self&quot;), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to &quot;autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kuhn R | title = Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology | journal = Hist Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 361–6 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15386868 | doi = 10.1177/0957154X04044603 }} The quote is a translation of Bleuler's 1910 original.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''autism'' first took its modern sense in 1938 when [[Hans Asperger]] of the [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna University Hospital]] adopted Bleuler's terminology ''autistic psychopaths'' in a lecture in German about [[child psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | journal=Wien Klin Wochenschr |year=1938 |volume=51 |pages=1314–7 | title = Das psychisch abnormale Kind |trans_title=The psychically abnormal child | vauthors = Asperger H | author-link1 = Hans Asperger | language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as [[Asperger syndrome]], though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] first used ''autism'' in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label ''early infantile autism'' in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kanner1943&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kanner L | author-link1 = Leo Kanner |title=Autistic disturbances of affective contact |journal=Nerv Child |volume=2 |pages=217–50 |year=1943 }} Reprinted in {{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kanner L | title =  | journal = Acta Paedopsychiatr | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 100–36 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4880460 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably &quot;autistic aloneness&quot; and &quot;insistence on sameness&quot;, are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.&lt;ref name=HappeTime/&gt; It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lyons&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Lyons V, Fitzgerald M | title = Asperger (1906–1980) and Kanner (1894–1981), the two pioneers of autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 2022–3 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17922179 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0383-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanner's reuse of ''autism'' led to decades of confused terminology like ''infantile schizophrenia'', and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to &quot;[[refrigerator mother]]s&quot;. Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from intellectual disability and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Fombonne E | title = Modern views of autism | journal = Can J Psychiatry | volume = 48 | issue = 8 | pages = 503–5 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14574825 | url = http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/Publications/Archives/CJP/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20130526200951/http://ww1.cpa-apc.org:8080/publications/archives/cjp/2003/september/guesteditorial.asp | archivedate = 2013-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite book |chapter=Genetic epidemiology of autism spectrum disorders |author=[[Peter Szatmari|Szatmari P]], Jones MB |pages=157–78 |title=Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorders |edition=2nd |editor=Volkmar FR |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-521-54957-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD,&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; parents continue to feel [[social stigma]] in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively by others,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Chambres P, Auxiette C, Vansingle C, Gil S | title = Adult attitudes toward behaviors of a six-year-old boy with autism | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 38 | issue = 7 | pages = 1320–7 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18297387 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-007-0519-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many [[primary care physician]]s and [[medical specialist]]s still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Heidgerken AD, Geffken G, Modi A, Frakey L | title = A survey of autism knowledge in a health care setting | journal = J Autism Dev Disord | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–30 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16119473 | doi = 10.1007/s10803-005-3298-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albedo-e hg.svg|thumb|Percentage of diffusely reflected sunlight in relation to various surface conditions]]

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}), or ''reflection coefficient'', derived from [[Latin]] ''albedo'' &quot;whiteness&quot; (or reflected sunlight) in turn from ''albus'' &quot;white&quot;, is the [[diffuse reflection|diffuse reflectivity]] or reflecting power of a surface. It is the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Its [[Dimensionless number|dimensionless]] nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.

Albedo depends on the [[frequency]] of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation, except for [[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian surfaces]], which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an albedo that is independent of the incident distribution. In practice, a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface, but albedo is very useful as a first approximation.

The albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and calculating [[reflectivity]] of surfaces in [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] sustainable-rating systems for buildings. The average overall albedo of Earth, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30 to 35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Encyclopedia, 3rd ed., Thompson Gale, 2003, ISBN 0-7876-5486-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced into optics by [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] in his 1760 work ''[[Photometria]]''.

Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a [[black body]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html |title=Albedo – from Eric Weisstein's World of Physics |publisher=Scienceworld.wolfram.com |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average albedo of [[Earth]] is about 0.3.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goode&quot;/&gt; This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

[[File:Ceres 2003 2004 clear sky total sky albedo.png|thumb|200px|left|2003–2004 mean annual clear-sky and total-sky albedo]]
Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments on board the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra]] and [[Aqua (satellite)|Aqua]] satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a [[mathematical model]] of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot;/&gt;).

Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the [[greenhouse effect]] is currently about 15&amp;nbsp;°C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective) the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;washington&quot; /&gt; If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;clim-past&quot;/&gt; In contrast, if the entire Earth is covered by water—a so-called aquaplanet—the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith Robin&quot;/&gt;

===White-sky and black-sky albedo===
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, &lt;math&gt;\bar{ \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

Albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can then be given as:

:&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar{ \bar \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Directional-hemispherical reflectance]] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]] as white-sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlueskyAlbedo&quot;/&gt;

==Astronomical albedo==
The albedos of [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]] and [[asteroid]]s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer [[Solar System]] objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], with an albedo of 0.96.&lt;ref name=&quot;sicardy&quot;&gt;

The overall albedo of the [[Moon]] is around 0.12, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong [[opposition effect]].&lt;ref name=&quot;medkeff&quot; /&gt; Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the [[regolith]] surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) [[geometric albedo]] (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the [[Bond albedo]] (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five [[Hapke parameters]] which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with [[phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]], including a characterization of the opposition effect of [[regolith]] surfaces.

where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the astronomical albedo, &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the diameter in kilometers, and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute magnitude.

==Examples of terrestrial albedo effects==

===Illumination===
Although the albedo–temperature effect is best known in colder, whiter regions on Earth, the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater. The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between three and twelve degrees north.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite journal| first=Jay |last=Winston |title=The Annual Course of Zonal Mean Albedo as Derived From ESSA 3 and 5 Digitized Picture Data |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=99 |pages=818–827| bibcode=1971MWRv...99..818W| date=1971| doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1971)099&lt;0818:TACOZM&gt;2.3.CO;2| issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.&lt;ref name=Winston/&gt;

===Insolation effects ===
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local [[insolation]]; high albedo areas in the [[arctic]] and [[antarctic]] regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the [[Sahara Desert]], which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation.  [[Tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] [[rain forest]] areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their [[temperate forest]] counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

===Climate and weather===
Albedo affects [[climate]] and drives [[weather]]. All weather is a result of the uneven heating of Earth caused by different areas of the planet having different albedos. Essentially, for the driving of weather, there are two types of albedo regions on Earth: Land and ocean. Land and ocean regions produce the four basic different types of [[air masses]], depending on latitude and therefore [[insolation]]: Warm and dry, which form over tropical and sub-tropical land masses; warm and wet, which form over tropical and sub-tropical oceans; cold and dry which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar land masses; and cold and wet, which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar oceans. Different temperatures between the air masses result in different air pressures, and the masses develop into [[pressure systems]]. High pressure systems flow toward lower pressure, driving weather from north to south in the northern hemisphere, and south to north in the lower; however due to the spinning of Earth, the [[Coriolis effect]] further complicates flow and creates several weather/climate bands and the [[jet stream]]s.

===Albedo–temperature feedback===
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature [[feedback]] results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g. a warm [[air mass]]), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local [[weather]] is dynamic due to the change of [[season]]s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher [[insolation]]) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

===Snow===
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, D.K. and Martinec, J. (1985), Remote sensing of ice and snow. Chapman and Hall, New York, 189 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo [[positive feedback]]). [[Cryoconite]], powdery windblown [[dust]] containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nat. Geo&quot;&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/06/melt-zone/jenkins-text/3 &quot;Changing Greenland – Melt Zone&quot;] page 3, of 4, article by Mark Jenkins in ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' June 2010, accessed 8 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Hence, small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates, which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions.

===Small-scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.&lt;ref name=&quot;ranknfile-ue&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ranknfile-ue.org/h&amp;s0897.html |title=Health and Safety: Be Cool! (August 1997) |publisher=Ranknfile-ue.org |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar photovoltaic effects ===
Albedo can affect the [[electrical energy]] output of solar [[photovoltaic system|photovoltaic device]]s. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrews | first1 = Rob W. | last2 = Pearce | first2 = Joshua M. | date = 2013 | title = The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance | url = | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 233–241 | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = M.P. | authorlink4 = J. M. Pearce | last2 = Abramase | first2 = A.L. | last3 = Andrews | first3 = R.W. | last4 = Pearce | first4 = J.

===Trees===
Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and [[visible spectrum]] is absorbed through [[photosynthesis]]), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of [[deforestation]]). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Betts | first1 = RA | date = 2000 | title = Offset of the potential carbon sink from boreal forestation by decreases in surface albedo | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 408 | issue = 6809| pages = 187–190 | doi = 10.1038/35041545 | pmid=11089969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through [[evapotranspiration]]. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Boucher | first1 =  et al. | date = 2004 | title = Direct human influence of irrigation on atmospheric water vapour and climate | url = | journal = Climate Dynamics | volume = 22 | issue = 6–7| pages = 597–603 | doi=10.1007/s00382-004-0402-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bonan | first1 = GB | date = 2008 | title = Forests and Climate Change: Forcings, Feedbacks, and the Climate Benefits of Forests | url = | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5882| pages = 1444–1449 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155121 | pmid=18556546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. [[Deciduous trees]] have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas [[coniferous trees]] have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;mmutrees&quot; /&gt;

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Betts&quot; /&gt;

===Water===
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the [[Fresnel equations]] (see graph).
[[File:water reflectivity.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Reflectivity of smooth water at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (refractive index=1.333)]]
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally [[specular reflection|specular manner]] (not [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely]]). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small [[angle of incidence|angles of incident]] light, [[waviness]] results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fresnel&quot; /&gt;

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.

===Clouds===
[[Cloud albedo]] has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. &quot;On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;livescience&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060124_earth_albedo.html |title=Baffled Scientists Say Less Sunlight Reaching Earth |publisher=LiveScience |date=24 January 2006 |accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;uww&quot; /&gt; A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10&amp;nbsp;°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvard&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Kuwait oil fires as seen by Landsat |publisher=Adsabs.harvard.edu |date=30 May 1991|bibcode=1992JGR....9714565C |author1=Cahalan |first1=Robert F. |volume=97 |pages=14565 |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |doi=10.1029/92JD00799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerosol effects===
[[Aerosols]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]] and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671 |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=19 August 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629175429/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per &lt;ref name=&quot;DOMINICK&quot; /&gt; the effects are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- Aerosol radiative forcing. --&gt;
* ''Aerosol direct effect.'' Aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation. The scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling, whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming.
* ''Aerosol indirect effect.'' Aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called [[cloud condensation nuclei]]. Increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations, which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo, increased light scattering and radiative cooling (''first indirect effect''), but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud (''second indirect effect'').
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from [[black carbon]] particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;girda 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm |title=Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=19 August 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110629180154/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm| archivedate= 29 June 2011&lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l. Acad. of Sci. 423 (13 January 2004) (&quot;The efficacy of this forcing is »2 (i.e. for a given forcing it is twice as effective as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in altering global surface air temperature)&quot;); ''compare'' Zender Testimony, ''supra'' note 7, at 4 (figure 3); See J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 18, at 426. (&quot;The efficacy for changes of Arctic sea ice albedo is &gt;3. In additional runs not shown here, we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in Antarctica is also &gt;3.&quot;); ''See also'' Flanner, M.G., C.S. Zender, J.T. Randerson, and P.J. Rasch, ''Present-day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow'', 112 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D11202 (2007) (&quot;The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset, triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the &quot;efficacy&quot; of black carbon/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human activities===
Human activities (e.g. deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Other types of albedo==
[[Single-scattering albedo]] is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material ([[refractive index]]); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

'''Assyria''' was a major [[Mesopotamian]] [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] kingdom, and empire, of the [[Ancient Near East]], existing as an independent state for a period of approximately nineteen centuries from c. 2500 BC to 605 BC, spanning the [[Early Bronze Age]] through to the late [[Iron Age]]. For a further thirteen centuries, from the end of the 7th century BC to the mid-7th century AD, it survived as a [[geo-political]] entity, for the most part ruled by foreign powers, although a number of small [[Neo-Assyrian]] states such as [[Assur]], [[Adiabene]], [[Osroene]] and [[Hatra]] arose at different times between the 1st century BC and late 3rd century AD.

Centered on the Upper [[Tigris river]], in [[northern Mesopotamia]] (modern northern [[Iraq]], northeastern [[Syria]] and southeastern [[Turkey]]) the Assyrians came to rule powerful empires at several times, the last of which grew to be the largest and most powerful empire the world had yet seen.

As a substantial part of the greater [[Mesopotamian]] &quot;[[cradle of civilization]]&quot; which included [[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] and much later [[Babylonia]], Assyria was at the height of technological, scientific and cultural achievements for its time. At its peak, the Assyrian empire stretched from [[Cyprus]] in the Mediterranean Sea to [[Persia]] ([[Iran]]), and from what is now [[Armenia]] to the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Egypt]].

Assyria is named for its original capital, the ancient city of [[Aššur]] (a.k.a. [[Ashur]]) which dates to c. 2600 BC (located in what is now the [[Saladin Province]] of northern [[Iraq]]), originally one of a number of [[Akkadian]] city states in Mesopotamia. In the 25th and 24th centuries BC, Assyrian kings were pastoral leaders, and from the late 24th century BC became subject to [[Sargon of Akkad]], who united all the [[Akkadian]] [[Semites]] and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]-speaking peoples of Mesopotamia under the [[Akkadian Empire]], which lasted from c. 2334 BC to 2154 BC. Following the fall of the Akkadian Empire c. 2154 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', pp. 161–191.&lt;/ref&gt; and the short lived succeeding [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] which ruled southern Assyria but not the north, Assyria regained full independence.

The history of Assyria proper is roughly divided into three periods, known as Old Assyrian, Middle Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian. These terms are in wide use in [[Assyrology]] and roughly correspond to the early to [[Middle Bronze Age]], [[Late Bronze Age]] and [[Early Iron Age]], respectively. In the Old Assyrian period, Assyria established colonies in [[Asia Minor]] and [[the Levant]] and, under king [[Ilushuma]], it asserted itself over southern Mesopotamia. From the mid 18th century BC, Assyria came into conflict with the newly created state of [[Babylonia]], which eventually eclipsed the far older Sumero-Akkadian states in the south, such as [[Ur]], [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]].

Assyria experienced fluctuating fortunes in the Old Assyrian period. Assyria became a regionally powerful nation with the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] from the late 21st century to the mid 18th century BC. Following this, it found itself under short periods of Babylonian and [[Mitanni]]-[[Hurrian]] in the 18th and 15th centuries BC respectively, and another period of great power occurred with the rise of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (from 1365 BC to 1056 BC), which included the reigns of great kings, such as [[Ashur-uballit I]], [[Arik-den-ili]], [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] and [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. During this period, Assyria overthrew the [[Mitanni]]-Empire and eclipsed the [[Hittite Empire]], [[Egyptian Empire]], [[Babylonia]], [[Elam]] and [[Phrygia]] in the [[Near East]].

Beginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]] from 911 BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot;&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq''{{page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it again became a great power over the next three centuries, overthrowing the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt]] and conquering [[Egypt]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot;/&gt; Babylonia, [[Elam]], [[Urartu]], [[Armenians|Armenia]], [[Media (region)|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Mannaeans|Mannea]], [[Gutium]], [[Phoenicia]]/[[Canaan]], [[Aramea]] ([[Syria]]), [[Arabia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Edom]], [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], [[Samarra]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Chaldea]], [[Nabatea]], [[Commagene]], [[Dilmun]], [[Libya]], the [[Hurrians]], [[Sutu, Iran|Sutu]] and [[Neo-Hittites]], driving the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]], [[Kushites]] and [[Nubians]] from Egypt,&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot;/&gt; subjugating the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] and exacting tribute from [[Phrygia]], [[Majan (civilization)|Magan]] and [[Land of Punt|Punt]]{{clarify|date=April 2014}} among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot;/&gt;

After its fall (between 612 BC and 605 BC), Assyria remained a province and geo-political entity under the Babylonian, Median, [[Achaemenid]], [[Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Sassanid]] empires until the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] invasion and conquest of Mesopotamia in the mid-7th century AD, when it was finally dissolved, after which the remnants of the [[Assyrian people]] (by now almost exclusively [[East Syrian Rite|Eastern Rite]] [[Assyrian Christians]]) gradually became an ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious minority in the traditional [[Assyrian homeland]]s, surviving there to this day. (see [[Assyrian continuity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Parpola, Simo 2004&quot;&gt;Parpola, Simo (2004). &quot;National and Ethnic Identity in the Neo-Assyrian Empire and Assyrian Identity in Post-Empire Times&quot; (PDF).

After its dissolution in the mid 7th century AD it remained ''The Ecclesiastical Province of Ator''. The term ''Assyria'' can also refer to the geographic region or heartland where Assyria, its empires and the Assyrian people were (and still are) centered. The modern [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christian]] (AKA [[Chaldo-Assyrian]]) ethnic minority in northern [[Iraq]], north east [[Syria]], south east Turkey and north west [[Iran]] are the descendants of the ancient Assyrians (see [[Assyrian continuity]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;H.W.F. Saggs&quot;&gt;Saggs notes that: &quot;the destruction of the Assyrian empire did not wipe out its population. They were predominantly peasant farmers and, since Assyria contains some of the best wheat land in the Near East, their descendants would, as opportunity permitted, build new villages over the old cities and carry on with agricultural life, remembering traditions of the former cities. After seven or eight centuries and various vicissitudes, these people became Christians&quot; (''[[The Might That Was Assyria]]'', p. 290).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf |title=Parpola identity_article|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110717071922/http://www.jaas.org/edocs/v18n2/Parpola-identity_Article%20-Final.pdf| archivedate= 17 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-history of Assyria==
In prehistoric times, the region that was to become known as Assyria (and Subartu) was home to a [[Neanderthal]] culture such as has been found at the [[Shanidar Cave]]. The earliest [[Neolithic]] sites in Assyria were the [[Jarmo]] culture c. 7100 BC and [[Hassuna|Tell Hassuna]], the centre of the ''Hassuna culture'', c. 6000 BC.

During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkad]]ians throughout [[Mesopotamia]], which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].&lt;ref name='Deutscher'&gt;{{Cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20–21|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] (a [[language isolate]], i.e. not related to any other language) on [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.&lt;ref name='Deutscher'/&gt; This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.&lt;ref name='Deutscher'/&gt;
[[File:Letter Luenna Louvre AO4238.jpg|thumb|Letter sent by the high-priest Lu'enna to the king of [[Lagash]] (maybe [[Urukagina]]), informing him of his son's death in combat, c. 2400 BC, found in [[Girsu]].]]
Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere after the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot;&gt;Woods C. 2006 &quot;Bilingualism, Scribal Learning, and the Death of Sumerian&quot;. In S.L. Sanders (ed) ''Margins of Writing, Origins of Culture'': 91–120 Chicago [http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/OIS2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

The cities of [[Assur]] (also spelled [[Ashur]] or [[Aššur]]) and [[Nineveh]], together with a number of other towns and cities, existed since at least before the middle of the 3rd millennium BC (c. 2600 BC), although they appear to have been Sumerian-ruled administrative centres at this time, rather than independent states.

According to some [[Judaeo-Christian]] writers {{who|date=September 2014}}, the city of Ashur was founded by [[Ashur (Bible)|Ashur]] the son of [[Shem]], who was deified by later generations as the city's patron god {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}. However, it is not among the cities said to have been founded by him in Genesis 10:11–12, and the far older Assyrian annals make no mention of the much later Judeo-Christian figures of Shem and Ashur.

Assyrian tradition lists an early Assyrian king named [[Ushpia]] as having dedicated the first temple to the god Ashur in the city in the 21st century BC. It is highly likely that the city was named in honour of its patron Assyrian god with the same name.

===Classical dating===
[[George Syncellus]] in his ''Chronographia'' quotes a fragment from [[Julius Africanus]] which dates the founding of Assyria to 2284 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cory's Ancient Fragments]], [[Isaac Preston Cory]], 1832, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman historian [[Velleius Paterculus]] citing Aemilius Sura states that Assyria was founded 1995 years before [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] was defeated in 197 BC (at the [[Battle of Cynoscephalae]]) by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;''Roman History'', Book 1, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The sum therefore 197 + 1995 = 2192 BC for the foundation of Assyria. [[Diodorus Siculus]] recorded another tradition from [[Ctesias]], that dates Assyria 1,306 years before 883 BC (the starting date of the reign of [[Ashurnasirpal II]]) and so the sum 883 + 1306 = 2189 BC.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Antiquity'' by Maximilian Duncker, 1877, p.&amp;nbsp;26–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' of Eusebius provides yet another date for the founding of Assyria, with the accession of [[Ninus]], dating to 2057 BC, but the Armenian translation of the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' puts this figure back slightly to 2116 BC. Another classical dating tradition found in the ''[[Excerpta Latina Barbari]]'' dates the foundation of Assyria, under [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], to 2206 BC.

==Early Assyria, 2600–2335 BC==
The city of Ashur, together with a number of other Assyrian cities, seem to have been established by 2600 BC, however it is likely that they were initially Sumerian dominated administrative centres. In c. the late 26th century BC, [[Eannatum]] of [[Lagash]], then the dominant [[Sumer]]ian ruler in Mesopotamia, mentions &quot;smiting [[Subartu]]&quot; (Subartu being the Sumerian name for Assyria). Similarly, in c. the early 25th century BC, [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]] the king of the Sumerian state of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] lists Subartu as paying tribute to him.

Of the early history of the kingdom of Assyria, little is positively known. In the [[Assyrian King List]], the earliest king recorded was [[Tudiya]]. In archaeological reports from [[Ebla]], it appeared that Tudiya's activities were confirmed with the discovery of a tablet where he concluded a treaty for the operation of a ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]'' (trading colony) in Eblaite territory, with &quot;king&quot; Ibrium of Ebla (who is now known to have been the [[vizier]] of Ebla for king [[Ishar-Damu]]). This entire reading is now questionable, as several scholars have more recently argued that the treaty in question may not have been with king Tudiya of Assyria, but rather with the unnamed king of an uncertain location called &quot;Abarsal&quot;.

Tudiya was succeeded on the list by [[Adamu]] and then a further thirteen rulers (Yangi, Shuhlamu, Harharu, Mandaru, Imshu, Harshu, Didanu, Hanu, Zuabu, Nuabu, Abazu, Belu and Azarah). Nothing concrete is yet known about these names, although it has been noted that a much later Babylonian tablet listing the ancestral lineage of [[Hammurabi]], the [[Amorite]] king of Babylon, seems to have copied the same names from Tudiya through Nuabu, though in a heavily corrupted form.

The earliest kings, such as Tudiya, who are recorded as ''kings who lived in tents'', were independent semi-nomadic pastoralist rulers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot;/&gt; These kings at some point became fully urbanised and founded the ''city state'' of [[Ashur]].&lt;ref&gt;Saggs, ''The Might'', 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assyria in the Akkadian Empire and Neo-Sumerian Empires==

During the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2334–2154 BC) the Assyrians, like all the Mesopotamian Semites (and also the Sumerians), became subject to the dynasty of the city state of [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], centered in central Mesopotamia. The Akkadian Empire founded by [[Sargon the Great]], claimed to encompass the surrounding &quot;four quarters&quot;. The region of Assyria, north of the seat of the empire in central Mesopotamia had also been known as [[Subartu]] by the Sumerians, and the name [[Azuhinum]] in Akkadian records also seems to refer to Assyria proper.

Assyrian rulers were subject to Sargon and his successors, and the city of Ashur became a regional administrative center of the Empire, implicated by the [[Nuzi#Archaeology|Nuzi tablets]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shendge1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Malati J. Shendge|title=The language of the Harappans: from Akkadian to Sanskrit|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Xb6CZMmwo00C&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-325-0|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, the Akkadian-speaking Semites of Mesopotamia came to rule an empire encompassing not only Mesopotamia itself but large swathes of Asia Minor, ancient Iran, Elam, the [[Arabian Peninsula]], Canaan and Syria.

Assyria seems to have already been firmly involved in trade in Asia Minor by this time; the earliest known reference to Anatolian ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]''s in [[Hittite empire|Hatti]], was found on later cuneiform tablets describing the early period of the Akkadian Empire (c. 2350 BC). On those tablets, Assyrian traders in [[Burushanda]] implored the help of their ruler, Sargon the Great, and this appellation continued to exist throughout the Assyrian Empire for about 1,700 years. The name &quot;Hatti&quot; itself even appears in later accounts of his grandson, [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]], campaigning in Anatolia.

Assyrian and Akkadian traders spread the use of writing in the form of the Mesopotamian [[cuneiform]] script to [[Asia Minor]] and [[The Levant]] (modern [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]).

However, towards the end of the reign of [[Sargon the Great]], the Assyrian faction rebelled against him; &quot;the tribes of Assyria of the upper country—in their turn attacked, but they submitted to his arms, and Sargon settled their habitations, and he smote them grievously&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Malati J. Shendge (1 January 1997). The language of the Harappans: from Akkadian to Sanskrit. Abhinav Publications. p. 46. ISBN 978-81-7017-325-0. Retrieved 22 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akkadian Empire was destroyed by economic decline and internal civil war, followed by attacks from barbarian [[Gutian people]] in 2154 BC.

The rulers of Assyria during the period between c. 2154 BC and 2112 BC once again became fully independent, as the Gutians are only known to have administered southern Mesopotamia. However, the king list is the only information from Assyria for this period.

Most of Assyria briefly became part of the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]] (or [[3rd dynasty of Ur]]) founded in c. 2112 BC. Sumerian domination extended as far as the city of Ashur, but appears not to have reached Nineveh and the far north of Assyria. One local ruler (''shakkanakku'') named [[Zāriqum]] (who does not appear on any Assyrian king list) is listed as paying tribute to [[Amar-Sin]] of Ur. Ashur's rulers appear to have remained largely under Sumerian domination until the mid-21st century BC (c. 2050 BC); the king list names Assyrian rulers for this period and several are known from other references to have also borne the title of ''shakkanakka'' or vassal governors for the neo-Sumerians.

==Old Assyrian Kingdom==
The first written inscriptions by 'urbanised' Assyrian kings appear in the mid-21st century BC, after they had shrugged off Sumerian domination. The land of Assyria as a whole then consisted of a number of city states and small Semitic kingdoms, some of which were initially independent of Assyria. The foundation of the first major temple in the city of Ashur was traditionally ascribed to king [[Ushpia]] who reigned c. 2050 BC, possibly a contemporary of [[Ishbi-Erra]] of [[Isin]] and [[Naplanum]] of [[Larsa]].&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[Assyrian King List]] and Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was reputedly succeeded by kings named [[Apiashal]], [[Sulili]], [[Kikkiya]] and [[Akiya]] (died c. 2026 BC), of whom little is known, apart from much later mentions of Kikkiya conducting fortifications on the city walls, and building work on temples in Ashur.

The main rivals, neighbours or trading partners to early Assyrian kings during the 22nd, 21st and 20th centuries BC would have been the [[Hattians]] and [[Hurrians]] to the north in Asia Minor, the [[Gutians]], [[Lullubi]] and [[Turukku]] to the east in the [[Zagros Mountains]] of northwest [[Ancient Iran]], the [[Elamites]] to the southeast in what is now south central Iran, the [[Amorites]] to the west in what is today Syria, and their fellow [[Sumero-Akkadian]] city-states of southern Mesopotamia such as [[Isin]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Ur]], [[Eshnunna]] and [[Larsa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot;/&gt;

Like many city-states in early Mesopotamian history, Ashur was, to a great extent, originally an [[oligarchy]] rather than a monarchy. Authority was considered to lie with &quot;the City&quot;, and the polity had three main centres of power—an assembly of elders, a hereditary ruler, and an [[eponym]]. The ruler presided over the assembly and carried out its decisions. He was not referred to with the usual Akkadian term for &quot;king&quot;, ''šarrum''/''Sharru''; that was instead reserved for the city's patron deity [[Assur (god)|Assur]], of whom the ruler was the high priest. The ruler himself was only designated as &quot;the steward of Assur&quot; (''iššiak Assur''), where the term for steward is a borrowing from Sumerian ''[[ENSI|ensi(k)]]''. The third centre of power was the eponym (''limmum''), who gave the year his name, similarly to the later [[archons of Athens|archons]] and [[Roman consul|consuls]] of [[Classical Antiquity]]. He was annually elected by [[Sortition|lot]] and was responsible for the economic administration of the city, which included the power to detain people and confiscate property. The institution of the eponym as well as the formula ''iššiak Assur'' lingered on as ceremonial vestiges of this early system throughout the history of the Assyrian monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, Mogens Trolle (2000): &quot;The old Assyrian city-state&quot;. In Hansen, Mogens Herman, ''A comparative study of thirty city-state cultures: an investigation / conducted by the Copenhagen Polis Centre'', p.&amp;nbsp;77–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Refers to entire paragraph on political structure--&gt;

===Dynasty of Puzur-Ashur I, 2025–1809 BC, Old Assyrian Empire===
In approximately 2025 BC (long chronology), [[Puzur-Ashur I]] (perhaps a contemporary of [[Shu-ilishu]] of Larsa and [[Samium]] of Isin) is speculated to have overthrown Kikkiya and founded a new dynasty which was to survive for 216 years. His descendants left inscriptions mentioning him regarding the building of temples to gods such as Ashur, [[Adad]] and [[Ishtar]] in Assyria. The length of his reign is unknown.

[[Shalim-ahum]] (died c. 2009 BC) succeeded the throne at a currently unknown date. He left inscriptions in archaic Old Assyrian regarding the construction of a temple dedicated to the god Ashur, and the placement of [[beer vats]] within it.

[[Ilushuma]]&lt;ref&gt;Lines 27 to 28&lt;!-- OF WHAT?--&gt;: [IE-r]i-šu dumu Iilu-šum-ma [šá li-ma-ni]-šu-ni 40 mumeš lugalta dùuš.&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 2008–1975 BC) took the throne in c. 2008 BC, and is known from his inscription (extant in several copies) where he claims to have &quot;washed the copper&quot; and &quot;established liberty&quot; for the Akkadians in Sumerian city-states as far as the Persian Gulf. This has been taken by some scholars to imply that he made military campaigns into Southern Mesopotamia to relieve his fellow Mesopotamians from Amorite and Elamite invasions, however some recent scholars have taken the view that the inscription means he supplied these areas with copper from [[Hittite empire|Hatti]], and that the word used for &quot;liberty&quot; (''adduraru'') is usually in the context of his exempting the southern Mesopotamian kings from tariffs.

&quot;The freedom&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Freedom: ''addurāru''.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Akkadians and their children I established. I purified their copper. I established their freedom from the border of the marshes and Ur and Nippur, [[Awal]], and Kish, [[Der (Sumer)|Der]] of the goddess Ishtar, as far as the City of (Ashur).&quot;&lt;ref name=grayson&gt;{{ cite book | title = Assyrian Royal Inscriptions, Volume 1 | author = A. K. Grayson | publisher = Otto Harrassowitz | year = 1972 | pages = 7–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyria had long held extensive contact with Hattian, Hittite and Hurrian cities on the Anatolian plateau in Asia Minor. The Assyrians who had for centuries traded in the region, and possibly ruled small areas bordering Assyria, now established significant colonies in [[Cappadocia]] (e.g., at [[Kanesh]] (modern [[Kültepe]]) from 2008 BC to 1740 BC). These colonies, called ''[[Karum (trade post)|karum]]'', from the Akkadian word for 'port', were attached to Hattian cities in Anatolia, but physically separate, and had special tax status. They must have arisen from a long tradition of trade between Assyria and the Anatolian cities, but no archaeological or written records show this. The trade consisted of metals (copper or tin and perhaps iron; the terminology is not entirely clear) being traded for textiles from Assyria.

[[Erishum I]]&lt;ref&gt;Tablet copies: An 201139 and An 20114&lt;/ref&gt; (c. 1974–1935 BC) vigorously expanded Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor during his long reign, the major ones appearing to be at Kanesh, [[Ḫattuša]] ([[Boğazköy]]) (the future capital of the [[Hittite Empire]]) and [[Amkuwa]] ([[Alisar Höyük]]), together with a further eighteen smaller colonies. He created some of the earliest examples of [[Written Law]], conducted extensive building work in the form of fortifying the walls of major Assyrian cities and the erection of temples dedicated to Ashur and Ishtar. It is from his reign that the continuous ''limmum'' lists are known, however there are references to the eponym-books for his predecessors having been destroyed at some point.

[[Ikunum]] (c. 1934–1921 BC)&lt;ref&gt;Cahit Günbattı, An Eponym List (KEL G) from Kültepe Altoriental. Forsch. 35 (2008) 1, 103–132.&lt;/ref&gt; built a major temple for the god [[Ningal]]. He further strengthened the fortifications of the city of Assur and maintained Assyria's colonies in Asia Minor.

[[Sargon I]] (c. 1920–1881 BC)&lt;ref&gt;Klaas R. Veenhof, The old Assyrian list of year eponyms from Karum Kanish and its chronological implications (Ankara, Turkish Historical Society, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; succeeded him in c. 1920 BC, and had an unusually long reign of 39 years. It is likely he was named after his illustrious predecessor [[Sargon of Akkad]]. He is known to have refortified the defences of major Assyrian cities, and maintained Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor during his reign. Apart from this, little has yet been unearthed about him. At some point he appears to have withdrawn Assyrian aid to southern Mesopotamia. It was during his reign in Assyria that the initially minor city-state of [[Babylon]] was founded in 1894 BC by an [[Amorite]] ''Malka'' (prince) named [[Sumuabum]].

[[Puzur-Ashur II]] (c. 1881–1873 BC) came to the throne as an already older man due to his fathers long reign. Little is known about his rule, but it appears to have been uneventful.

[[Naram-Sin of Assyria|Naram-Suen]] (c. 1872–1818 BC) ascended to the throne in 1872 BC, and is likely named after his predecessor [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]] of the Akkadian Empire. Assyria continued to be wealthy during his 54-year-long reign (one of the longest in the ancient Near East), and he defeated the future usurper king [[Shamshi-Adad I]] who attempted to take his throne.

[[Erishum II]] (c. 1818–1809 BC) was to be the last king of the dynasty of Puzur-Ashur I, founded c. 2025 BC. After only eight or nine years in power he was overthrown by Shamshi-Adad I, the Amorite usurper who had previously been defeated in an attempt to unseat [[Naram-Sin of Assyria|Naram-Suen]], and who claimed legitimacy by asserting descent from the mid 21st century BC Assyrian king, [[Ushpia]].

===Amorite Period in Assyria, 1809–1750 BC===
The Amorites were successfully repelled by the Assyrian kings of the 20th and 19th centuries BC.
However, in 1809 BC the native Mesopotamian king of Assyria [[Erishum II]] was deposed, and the throne of Assyria was usurped by [[Shamshi-Adad I]] (c. 1809 – 1776 BC) in the expansion of Semitic [[Amorite]] tribes from the [[Khabur River]] delta in the north eastern Levant.

Although regarded as an Amorite by later Assyrian tradition, Shamshi-Adad's descent is suggested to be from the same line as the native Mesopotamian ruler Ushpia in the [[Assyrian King List]]. He put his son [[Ishme-Dagan]] on the throne of a nearby Assyrian city, [[Ekallatum]], and maintained Assyria's Anatolian colonies. Shamshi-Adad I then went on to conquer the kingdom of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] (in modern Syria) on the [[Euphrates]] putting another of his sons, [[Yasmah-Adad]] on the throne there. Shamshi-Adad's Assyria now encompassed the whole of northern Mesopotamia and included territory in central Mesopotamia, Asia Minor and northern Syria. Shamshi-Adad I mentions conducting raids on the [[Canaan]]ite coasts of the far off [[Mediterranean]], where he erected stelae to commemorate his victories. He himself resided in a new capital city founded in the Khabur valley in northern Mesopotamia, called [[Shubat-Enlil]].

[[Ishme-Dagan I]] (1774–1763 BC) inherited Assyria, but Yasmah-Adad was overthrown by a new king called [[Zimrilim]] in Mari. The new king of Mari allied himself with the [[Amorite]] king [[Hammurabi]] of [[Babylon]], who had made the recently created, and originally minor state of Babylon into a major power. It was from the reign of Hammurabi onwards that southern Mesopotamia came to be known as [[Babylonia]].

Assyria now faced the rising power of Babylon in the south. Ishme-Dagan responded by making an alliance with the enemies of Babylon, and the power struggle continued without resolution for decades. Ishme-Dagan, like his father was a great warrior, and in addition to repelling Babylonian attacks, campaigned successfully against the [[Turukku]] and [[Lullubi]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] (in modern Iran) who had attacked the Assyrian city of [[Ekallatum]], and against [[Dadusha]], king of [[Eshnunna]], and the state of [[Iamhad]] (modern [[Aleppo]]).

===Assyria under Babylonian domination, 1750–1732 BC===
Hammurabi, after first conquering Mari, Larsa, and [[Eshnunna]], eventually prevailed over Ishme-Dagan's successor [[Mut-Ashkur]] (1750–1740 BC), and subjected him to Babylon c. 1750 BC. With Hammurabi, the various ''karum'' colonies in Anatolia ceased trade activity—probably because the goods of Assyria were now being traded with the Babylonians. The Assyrian monarchy survived, however the three Amorite kings succeeding Ishme-Dagan, [[Mut-Ashkur]] (who was the son of Ishme-Dagan and married to a Hurrian queen), [[Rimush]] (1739–1733 BC) and [[Asinum]] (1732 BC), were vassals, dependent on the Babylonians during the reign of Hammurabi, and for a short time, of his successor [[Samsu-iluna]].

===Assyrian Adaside dynasty, 1732–1451 BC===
The short lived [[Babylonian Empire]] quickly began to unravel upon the death of Hammurabi, and Babylonia lost control over Assyria during the reign of Hammurabi's successor [[Samsu-iluna]] (1750–1712 BC). A period of civil war ensued after Asinum (a grandson of Shamshi-Adad I and the last Amorite ruler of Assyria) was deposed in approximately 1732 BC by a powerful native Assyrian vice regent named [[Puzur-Sin]], who regarded Asinum as both a foreigner and a former lackey of Babylon.

A native king named [[Ashur-dugul]] seized the throne in 1732 BC, probably with the help of Puzur-Sin. However, he was unable to retain control for long, and was soon deposed by a rival claimant, [[Ashur-apla-idi]]. Internal instability ensued with four further kings ([[Nasir-Sin]], [[Sin-namir]], [[Ipqi-Ishtar]] and [[Adad-salulu]]) all reigning in quick succession over a period of approximately six years between 1732 and 1727 BC. Babylonia seems to have been too powerless to intervene or take advantage of this situation.

Finally, a king named [[Adasi]] (1726–1701 BC) came to the fore c. 1726 BC and managed to quell the civil unrest and stabilise the situation in Assyria. Adasi completely drove the Babylonians and Amorites from the Assyrian sphere of influence during his reign, and Babylonian power began to quickly wane in Mesopotamia as a whole, also losing the far south of Mesopotamia (an area roughly corresponding to ancient [[Sumer]]) to the native Akkadian-speaking [[Sealand Dynasty]], although the Amorites would retain control over a much reduced and weak Babylonia itself until 1595 BC, when they were overthrown by the [[Kassites]], a people from the [[Zagros]] Mountains who spoke a [[language isolate]] and were neither Semites nor Indo-Europeans.
[[File:Dräkt, Assyrier, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|130px|Assyrian, 1400 BC]]

Adasi was succeeded by [[Bel-bani]] (1700–1691 BC) who is credited in Assyrian annals with inflicting further defeats on the Babylonians and Amorites, and further strengthening and stabilising the kingdom.

Little is currently known of many of the kings that followed such as; [[Libaya]] (1690–1674 BC), [[Sharma-Adad I]] (1673–1662 BC), [[Iptar-Sin]] (1661–1650 BC), [[Bazaya]] (1649–1622 BC) (a contemporary of [[Peshgaldaramesh]] of the [[Sealand Dynasty]]), [[Lullaya]] (1621–1618 BC) (who usurperped the throne from Bazaya), [[Shu-Ninua]] (1615–1602 BC) and [[Sharma-Adad II]] (1601–1599 BC). However, Assyria seems to have been a relatively strong and stable nation, existing undisturbed by its neighbours such as the Hatti, Hittites, Hurrians, Amorites, Babylonians, Elamites or Mitanni during this period.

Assyria remained strong and secure; when Babylon was sacked and its Amorite rulers deposed by the [[Hittite Empire]], and subsequently fell to the [[Kassites]] in 1595 BC, both powers were unable to make any inroads into Assyria, and there seems to have been no trouble between the first Kassite ruler of Babylon, [[Agum II]], and [[Erishum III]] (1598–1586 BC) of Assyria, and a mutually beneficial treaty was signed between the two rulers.

[[Shamshi-Adad II]] (1585–1580 BC), [[Ishme-Dagan II]] (1579–1562 BC) and [[Shamshi-Adad III]] (1562–1548 BC) seem also to have had peaceful tenures, although few records have thus far been discovered about their reigns. Similarly, [[Ashur-nirari I]] (1547–1522 BC) seems not to have been troubled by the newly founded Mitanni Empire in Asia Minor, the Hittite empire, or Babylon during his 25-year reign. He is known to have been an active king, improving the infrastructure, dedicating temples and conducting various building projects throughout the kingdom.

[[Puzur-Ashur III]] (1521–1498 BC) proved to be a strong and energetic ruler. He undertook much rebuilding work in Assur, the city was refortified and the southern quarters incorporated into the main city defences. Temples to the moon god [[Sin]] ([[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]]) and the sun god [[Shamash]] were erected during his reign. He signed a treaty with [[Burnaburiash I|Burna-Buriash I]] the Kassite king of Babylon, defining the borders of the two nations in the late 16th century BC. He was succeeded by [[Enlil-nasir I]] (1497–1483 BC) who appears to have had a peaceful an uneventful reign, as does his successor [[Nur-ili]] (1482–1471 BC).

The son of Nur-ili, [[Ashur-shaduni]] (1470 BC) was deposed by his uncle [[Ashur-rabi I]] (1470–1451 BC) in his first year of rule. Little is known about his nineteen-year reign, but it appears to have been largely uneventful.

===Assyria in decline, 1450–1393 BC===
The emergence of the Mitanni Empire in the 16th century BC did eventually lead to a short period of sporadic Mitanni-Hurrian domination in the latter half of the 15th century. The Indo-European speaking Mitanni are thought to have conquered and formed the ruling class over the indigenous Hurrians of eastern Anatolia. The Hurrians spoke a [[language isolate]], i.e. neither Semitic nor Indo-European.

[[Ashur-nadin-ahhe I]] (1450–1431 BC) was courted by the [[Egypt]]ians, who were rivals of the Mitanni, and attempting to gain a foothold in the [[Near East]]. [[Amenhotep II]] sent the Assyrian king a tribute of gold to seal an alliance against the Hurri-Mitanni empire. It is likely that this alliance prompted [[Saushtatar]], the Mitanni emperor, to invade Assyria, and sack the city of Ashur, after which Assyria became a sometime vassal state, with Ashur-nadin-ahhe I being forced to pay tribute to Saushtatar. He was deposed by his own brother [[Enlil-nasir II]] (1430–1425 BC) in 1430 BC, possibly with the aid of the Mitanni, who received tribute from the new king. [[Ashur-nirari II]] (1424–1418 BC) had an uneventful reign, and appears to have also paid tribute to the Mitanni Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot; /&gt;

The Assyrian monarchy survived, and the Mitanni influence appears to have been sporadic. They appear not to have been always willing or indeed able to interfere in Assyrian internal and international affairs.

[[Ashur-bel-nisheshu]] (1417–1409 BC) seems to have been independent of Mitanni influence, as evidenced by his signing a mutually beneficial treaty with [[Karaindash]], the Kassite king of Babylonia in the late 15th century. He also undertook extensive rebuilding work in Ashur itself, and Assyria appears to have redeveloped its former highly sophisticated financial and economic systems during his reign.

[[Ashur-rim-nisheshu]] (1408–1401 BC) also undertook building work, strengthening the city walls of the capital.

[[Ashur-nadin-ahhe II]] (1400–1393 BC) also received a tribute of gold and diplomatic overtures from Egypt, probably in an attempt to gain Assyrian military support against Egypt's Mitanni and Hittite rivals in the region. However, the Assyrian king appears not to have been in a strong enough position to challenge the Mitanni or Hittites.

[[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392–1366 BC), a son of Ashur-bel-nisheshu, ascended the throne in 1392 BC and finally broke the ties to the Mitanni Empire.

There are dozens of Mesopotamian cuneiform texts from this period, with precise observations of solar and lunar eclipses, that have been used as 'anchors' in the various attempts to define the [[chronology of Babylonia and Assyria]] for the early 2nd millennium BC (i.e., the &quot;high&quot;, &quot;middle&quot;, and &quot;low&quot; chronologies.)

Scholars variously date the beginning of the &quot;Middle Assyrian period&quot; to either the fall of the Old Assyrian kingdom of [[Shamshi-Adad I]], or to the ascension of [[Ashur-uballit I]] to the throne of Assyria.

===Assyrian expansion and empire, 1392–1056 BC===
{{See also|Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire}}
By the reign of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1392–1366 BC) Mitanni influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between [[Tushratta]] and his brother [[Artatama II]] and after this his son [[Shuttarna II]], who called himself king of the Hurri while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus finally broken Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs.

[[Ashur-uballit I]] (1365–1330 BC) succeeded the throne of Assyria in 1365 BC, and proved to be a fierce, ambitious and powerful ruler. Assyrian pressure from the southeast and Hittite pressure from the north-west, enabled Ashur-uballit I to break Mitanni power. He met and decisively defeated Shuttarna II, the Mitanni king in battle, making Assyria once more an imperial power at the expense of not only the Mitanni themselves, but also Kassite Babylonia, the Hurrians and the Hittites; and a time came when the Kassite king in Babylon was glad to marry [[Muballiṭat-Šērūa]], the daughter of Ashur-uballit, whose letters to [[Akhenaten]] of Egypt form part of the [[Amarna letters]].

This marriage led to disastrous results for Babylonia, as the Kassite faction at court murdered the half Assyrian Babylonian king and placed a pretender on the throne. Assur-uballit I promptly invaded Babylonia to avenge his son-in-law, entering Babylon, deposing the king and installing [[Kurigalzu II]] of the royal line king there.

Ashur-uballit I then attacked and defeated [[Shattiwaza|Mattiwaza]], the Mitanni king, despite attempts by the Hittite king [[Suppiluliumas]], now fearful of growing Assyrian power, to help the Mitanni. The lands of the Mitanni and Hurrians were duly appropriated by Assyria, making it a large and powerful empire.

[[Enlil-nirari]] (1329–1308 BC) succeeded Ashur-uballit I. He described himself as a &quot;Great-King&quot; (''Sharru rabû'') in letters to the Hittite kings. He was immediately attacked by Kurigalzu II of Babylon who had been installed by his father, but succeeded in defeating him, repelling Babylonian attempts to invade Assyria, counterattacking and appropriating Babylonian territory in the process, thus further expanding Assyria.

The successor of Enlil-nirari, [[Arik-den-ili]] (c. 1307–1296 BC), consolidated Assyrian power, and successfully campaigned in the [[Zagros]] Mountains to the east, subjugating the Lullubi and Gutians. In Syria, he defeated Semitic tribes of the so-called [[Ahlamu]] group, who were possibly predecessors of the Arameans or an Aramean tribe.

He was followed by [[Adad-nirari I]] (1295–1275 BC) who made [[Kalhu]] (Biblical [[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]) his capital, and continued expansion to the northwest, mainly at the expense of the Hittites and Hurrians, conquering Hittite territories such as [[Carchemish]] and beyond. He then moved into north eastern Asia Minor, conquering [[Shupria]].  Adad-nirari I made further gains to the south, annexing Babylonian territory and forcing the Kassite rulers of Babylon into accepting a new frontier agreement in Assyria's favour.

Adad-nirari's inscriptions are more detailed than any of his predecessors. He declares that the gods of Mesopotamia called him to war, a statement used by most subsequent Assyrian kings. He referred to himself again as ''Sharru Rabi'' (meaning &quot;The Great King&quot; in the Akkadian language) and conducted extensive building projects in Ashur and the provinces.

In 1274 BC [[Shalmaneser I]] (1274–1244 BC) ascended the throne. He proved to be a great warrior king. During his reign he conquered the Hurrian kingdom of [[Urartu]] that would have encompassed most of Eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus Mountains in the 9th century BC, and the fierce Gutians of the Zagros. He then attacked the Mitanni-Hurrians, defeating both King [[Shattuara]] and his Hittite and Aramaean allies, finally completely destroying the Hurri-Mitanni kingdom in the process.

During the campaign against the Hittites, Shattuara cut off the Assyrian army from their supply of food and water, but the Assyrians broke free in a desperate battle, counterattacked, and conquered and annexed what remained of the Mitanni kingdom. Shalmaneser I installed an Assyrian prince, [[Ilu-ippada]] as ruler of Mitanni, with Assyrian governors such as [[Meli-sah]], installed to rule individual cities.

The Hittites, having failed to save Mitanni, allied with Babylon in an unsuccessful economic war against Assyria for many years. Assyria was now a large and powerful empire, and a major threat to Egyptian and Hittite interests in the region, and was perhaps the reason that these two powers, fearful of Assyrian might, made peace with one another.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father, Shalmaneser was a great builder and he further expanded the city of Kalhu at the juncture of the Tigris and Zab Rivers.

Shalmaneser's son and successor, [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (1244–1207 BC), won a major victory against the Hittites and their king [[Tudhaliya IV]] at the [[Battle of Nihriya]] and took thousands of prisoners. He then conquered Babylonia, taking [[Kashtiliash IV]] as a captive and ruled there himself as king for seven years, taking on the old title &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot; first used by Sargon of Akkad. Tukulti-Ninurta I thus became the first Akkadian speaking native Mesopotamian to rule the state of Babylonia, its founders having been foreign Amorites, succeeded by equally foreign Kassites. Tukulti-Ninurta petitioned the god [[Shamash]] before beginning his counter offensive.&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;{{cite book | title = Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 2, Part 2, History of the Middle East and the Aegean Region, c. 1380–1000 BC | chapter = Assyrian Military Power, 1300–1200 B.C. | author = J.

The victorious Assyrian demolished the walls of Babylon, massacred many of the inhabitants, pillaged and plundered his way across the city to the [[Esagila]] temple, where he made off with the statue of [[Marduk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The ancient Near East: historical sources in translation | author = Christopher Morgan | editor = Mark William Chavalas | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | year = 2006 | pages = 145–152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then proclaimed himself &quot;king of Karduniash, king of Sumer and Akkad, king of [[Sippar]] and Babylon, king of [[Dilmun|Tilmun]] and [[Meluhha]].&quot;&lt;ref name=edwards/&gt; Middle Assyrian texts recovered at ancient [[Dūr-Katlimmu]], include a letter from Tukulti-Ninurta to his ''sukkal rabi'u'', or grand vizier, [[Ashur-iddin]] advising him of the approach of his general [[Shulman-mushabshu]] escorting the captive Kashtiliash, his wife, and his retinue which incorporated a large number of women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Dūr-Katlimmu 2008 and beyond | chapter = Production and Consumption at Dūr-Katlimmu: A Survey of the Evidence | author = Frederick Mario Fales | editor = Hartmut Kühne | publisher = Harrassowitz Verlag | year = 2010 | page = 82 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on his way to exile after his defeat. In the process he defeated the Elamites, who had themselves coveted Babylon. He also wrote an epic poem documenting his wars against Babylon and Elam. After a Babylonian revolt, he raided and plundered the temples in Babylon, regarded as an act of sacrilege. As relations with the priesthood in Ashur began deteriorating, Tukulti-Ninurta built a new capital city; [[Kar-Tukulti-Ninurta]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', pp. 26–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of historians, including [[Julian Jaynes]], identify [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] and his deeds as the historical origin for the fictional biblical character [[Nimrod]] in the Old Testament.

However, Tukulti-Ninurta's sons rebelled and besieged the ageing king in his capital. He was murdered and then succeeded by [[Ashur-nadin-apli]] (1206–1203 BC) who left the running of his empire to Assyrian regional governors such as [[Adad-bēl-gabbe]]. Another unstable period for Assyria followed, it was riven by periods of internal strife and the new king only made token and unsuccessful attempts to recapture Babylon, whose Kassite kings had taken advantage of the upheavals in Assyria and freed themselves from Assyrian rule. However, Assyria itself was not threatened by foreign powers during the reigns of [[Ashur-nirari III]] (1202–1197 BC), [[Enlil-kudurri-usur]] (1196–1193 BC) and [[Ninurta-apal-Ekur]] (1192–1180 BC), although Ninurta-apal-Ekur usurped the throne from Enlil-kudurri-usur.

[[Ashur-Dan I]] (1179–1133 BC) stabilised the internal unrest in Assyria during his unusually long reign, quelling instability. During the twilight years of the Kassite dynasty in Babylonia, he &lt;ref&gt;''Synchronistic History'', ii 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt; records that he seized northern Babylonia, including the cities of [[Zaban]], [[Irriya]] and [[Ugar-sallu]] during the reigns of [[Marduk-apla-iddina I]] and [[Zababa-shuma-iddin]], plundering them and &quot;taking their vast booty to Assyria.&quot; However, the conquest of northern Babylonia brought Assyria into direct conflict with Elam which had taken the remainder of Babylonia. The powerful Elamites, under king [[Shutruk-Nahhunte]], fresh from sacking Babylon, entered into a protracted war with Assyria, they briefly took the Assyrian city of [[Arrapkha]], which Ashur-Dan I then retook, eventually defeating the Elamites and forcing a treaty upon them in the process.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=kertai/&gt;--&gt;

Another very brief period of internal upheaval followed the death of Ashur-Dan I when his son and successor [[Ninurta-tukulti-Ashur]] (1133 BC) was deposed in his first year of rule by his own brother [[Mutakkil-Nusku]] and forced to flee to Babylonia. [[Mutakkil-Nusku]] himself died in the same year (1133 BC).

A third brother, [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] (1133–1116 BC) took the throne. This was to lead to a renewed period of Assyrian expansion and empire. As the Hittite empire collapsed from the onslaught of the Indo-European [[Phrygians]] (called [[Mushki]] in Assyrian annals), Babylon and Assyria began to vie for Aramaean regions (in modern Syria), formerly under firm Hittite control. When their forces encountered one another in this region, the Assyrian king [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] met and defeated [[Nebuchadnezzar I]] of Babylon on a number of occasions. Assyria then invaded and annexed Hittite-controlled lands in Asia Minor, Aram (Syria), and Gutians and Kassite regions in the Zagros, marking an upsurge in imperian expansion.

[[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (1115–1077 BC), vies with [[Shamshi-Adad I]] and [[Ashur-uballit I]] among historians as being regarded as the founder of the first Assyrian empire. The son of Ashur-resh-ishi I, he ascended to the throne upon his father's death, and became one of the greatest of Assyrian conquerors during his 38-year reign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot;&gt;The encyclopædia britannica: a dictionary of arts, sciences, literature and general information, Volume 26, Edited by Hugh Chrisholm, 1911, p. 968&lt;/ref&gt;

His first campaign in 1112 BC was against the Phrygians who had attempted to occupy certain Assyrian districts in the Upper Euphrates region of Asia Minor; after defeating and driving out the Phrygians he then overran the [[Luwian]] kingdoms of [[Commagene]], Cilicia and Cappadocia in western Asia Minor, and drove the Neo-Hittites from the Assyrian province of Subartu, northeast of [[Malatia]].

In a subsequent campaign, the Assyrian forces penetrated Urartu, into the mountains south of [[Lake Van]] and then turned westward to receive the submission of Malatia. In his fifth year, Tiglath-Pileser again attacked Commagene, Cilicia and Cappadocia, and placed a record of his victories engraved on copper plates in a fortress he built to secure his Anatolian conquests.

The Aramaeans of northern and central Syria were the next targets of the Assyrian king, who made his way as far as the sources of the Tigris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot;/&gt; The control of the high road to the Mediterranean was secured by the possession of the Hittite town of [[Pitru]]&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, Trevor. The Routledge Handbook of The People and Places of Ancient Western Asia: The Near East from the Early Bronze Age to the fall of the Persians Empire, p.563&lt;/ref&gt; at the junction between the Euphrates and [[Sajur]]; thence he proceeded to conquer the Canaanite/Phoenician city-states of [[Byblos]], [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Simyra]], [[Berytus]] ([[Beirut]]), [[Aradus]] and finally [[Arvad]] where he embarked onto a ship to sail the [[Mediterranean]], on which he killed a ''nahiru'' or &quot;sea-horse&quot; (which [[A. Leo Oppenheim]] translates as a [[narwhal]]) in the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot;/&gt; He was passionately fond of hunting and was also a great builder. The general view is that the restoration of the temple of the gods [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] and [[Hadad]] at the Assyrian capital of Assur (Ashur) was one of his initiatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugh Chrisholm 1911, p. 968&quot;/&gt;
He also invaded and defeated Babylon twice, assuming the old title &quot;King of Sumer and Akkad&quot;, forcing tribute from Babylon, although he did not actually depose the actual king in Babylonia, where the old ''Kassite Dynasty'' had now succumbed to an Elamite one.

He was succeeded by [[Asharid-apal-Ekur]] (1076–1074 BC) who reigned for just two years. His reign marked the elevation of the office of ''ummânu'' (royal scribe) in importance.

[[Ashur-bel-kala]] (1073–1056 BC) kept the vast empire together, campaigning successfully against Urartu and Phrygia to the north and the Arameans to the west. He maintained friendly relations with [[Marduk-shapik-zeri]] of Babylon, however upon the death of that king, he invaded Babylonia and deposed the new ruler [[Kadašman-Buriaš]], appointing [[Adad-apla-iddina]] as his vassal in Babylon. He built some of the earliest examples of both [[Zoological Gardens]] and [[Botanical Gardens]] in Ashur, collecting all manner of animals and plants from his empire, and receiving a collection of exotic animals as tributes from Egypt.

He was also a great hunter, describing his exploits &quot;at the city of [[Araziqu]] which is before the land of Hatti and at the foot of [[Mount Lebanon]].&quot; These locations show that well into his reign Assyria still controlled a vast empire.

Late in his reign, the Middle Assyrian Empire erupted into civil war, when a rebellion was orchestrated by [[Tukulti-Mer]], a pretender to the throne of Assyria. Ashur-bel-kala eventually crushed Tukulti-Mer and his allies, however the civil war in Assyria had allowed hordes of Arameans to take advantage of the situation, and press in on Assyrian controlled territory from the west. Ashur-bel-kala counterattacked them, and conquered as far as Carchemish and the source of the [[Khabur river]], but by the end of his reign many of the areas of Syria and Phoenicia-Canaan to the west of these regions as far as the Mediterranean, previously under firm Assyrian control, were eventually lost to the Assyrian Empire.

===Assyria during the Bronze Age Collapse, 1055–936 BC===
The [[Bronze Age Collapse]] from 1200 BC to 900 BC was a [[dark age (disambiguation)|dark age]] for the entire [[Near East]], [[North Africa]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Caucasus]], [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkan]] regions, with great upheavals and mass movements of people.

Assyria and its empire were not unduly affected by these tumultuous events for some 150 years, perhaps the only ancient power that was not. However, upon the death of [[Ashur-bel-kala]] in 1056 BC, Assyria went into a ''comparative'' decline for the next 100 or so years. The empire shrank significantly, and by 1020 BC Assyria appears to have controlled only areas close to Assyria itself, essential to keeping trade routes open in eastern Aramea, south eastern Asia Minor central Mesopotamia and north western Iran.

New [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] peoples such as the Arameans, [[Chaldea]]ns and [[Suteans]] moved into areas to the west and south of Assyria, including overrunning much of Babylonia to the south, Indo-European speaking [[Iranic]] peoples such as the [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Parthians]] moved into the lands to the east of Assyria, displacing the native Gutians and pressuring Elam and [[Mannea]] (which were all ancient non Indo-European civilisations of Iran), and to the north the Phrygians overran the Hittites, a new Hurrian state named Urartu arose in the Caucasus, and Cimmerians, [[Colchians]] (Georgians) and Scythians around the Black Sea and Caucasus. Egypt was divided and in disarray, and Israelites were battling with other fellow Semitic Canaanite peoples such as the [[Amalekites]], [[Moabites]], [[Edomites]] and [[Ammonites]] and the non-Semitic [[Peleset]]/[[Philistines]] (who were probably one of the so-called [[Sea Peoples]]) for the control of southern Canaan.

Despite the apparent weakness of Assyria in comparison to its former might, at heart it in fact remained a solid, well defended nation whose warriors were the best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux - Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt; Assyria, with its stable monarchy, powerful army and secure borders was in a stronger position during this time than potential rivals such as Egypt, Babylonia, Elam, Phrygia, Urartu, Persia and Media&lt;ref&gt;According to Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', pp.&amp;nbsp;282–283.&lt;/ref&gt; Kings such as [[Ashur-bel-kala]], [[Eriba-Adad II]], [[Ashur-rabi II]], [[Ashurnasirpal I]], [[Tiglath-Pileser II]] and [[Ashur-Dan II]] successfully defended Assyria's borders and upheld stability during this tumultuous time.

Assyrian kings during this period appear to have adopted a policy of maintaining and defending a compact, secure nation and satellite colonies immediately surrounding it, and interspersed this with sporadic punitive raids and invasions of neighbouring territories when the need arose.

[[Eriba-Adad II]] ruled for only two years, and in that time continued to campaign against the Arameans and neo-Hittites before he was deposed by his elderly uncle [[Shamshi-Adad IV]] (1053–1050 BC) who appears to have had an uneventful reign. [[Ashurnasirpal I]] (1049–1031 BC) succeeded him, and during his reign he continued to campaign endlessly against the Arameans to the west. Assyria was also afflicted by famine during this period. [[Shalmaneser II]] (1030–1019 BC) appears to have lost territory in the Levant to the Arameans, who also appear to have also occupied [[Nairi]] in southeast Asia Minor, hitherto an Assyrian colony.

[[Ashur-nirari IV]] took the throne in 1018 BC, and captured the Babylonian city of [[Atlila]] from [[Simbar-Shipak]] and continued Assyrian campaigns against the Arameans. He was eventually deposed by his uncle [[Ashur-rabi II]] in 1013 BC.

During the reign of [[Ashur-rabi II]] (1013–972 BC) Aramaean tribes took the cities of [[Pitru]] and [[Mutkinu]] (which had been taken and colonized by Tiglath Pileser I.) This event showed how far Assyria could assert itself militarily when the need arose. The Assyrian king attacked the Arameans, forced his way to the far off Mediterranean and constructed a [[stele]] in the area of [[Mount Atalur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=The Calculated Frightfulness of Ashur Nasir Pal|first=A.T.|last= Olmstead|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=38|year=1918|pages=209–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashur-resh-ishi II]] (971–968 BC) in all likelihood a fairly elderly man due to the length of his father's reign, had a largely uneventful period of rule, concerning himself with defending Assyria's borders and conducting various rebuilding projects within Assyria.

[[Tiglath-Pileser II]] (967–936 BC) succeeded him, and reigned for 28 years. He maintained the policies of his recent predecessors, but appears to have had an uneventful reign.

===Society in the Middle Assyrian period===
[[File:Assyrian troops return.png|thumb|Assyrian troops return after victory.]]
Assyria had difficulties with keeping the trade routes open. Unlike the situation in the Old Assyrian period, the Anatolian metal trade was effectively dominated by the [[Hittites]] and the [[Hurrians]]. These people now controlled the Mediterranean ports, while the [[Kassites]] controlled the river route south to the [[Persian Gulf]].

The Middle Assyrian kingdom was well organized, and in the firm control of the king, who also functioned as the High Priest of [[Anshar|Ashur]], the state god. He had certain obligations to fulfill in the cult, and had to provide resources for the temples. The priesthood became a major power in Assyrian society. Conflicts with the priesthood are thought to have been behind the murder of king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]].

The main Assyrian cities of the middle period were [[Assur|Ashur]], [[Kalhu]] ([[Nimrud]]) and [[Nineveh]], all situated in the [[Tigris]] River valley. At the end of the Bronze Age, Nineveh was much smaller than Babylon, but still one of the world's major cities (population c. 33,000). By the end of the Neo-Assyrian period, it had grown to a population of some 120,000, and was possibly the largest city in the world at that time.&lt;ref&gt;see [[historical urban community sizes]]. Estimates are those of Chandler (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; All free male citizens were obliged to serve in the army for a time, a system which was called the ''ilku''-service. A legal code was produced during the 14th and 13th centuries which, among other things, clearly shows that the social position of women in Assyria was lower than that of neighbouring societies. Men were permitted to divorce their wives with no compensation paid to the latter. If a woman committed adultery, she could be beaten or put to death. It's not certain if these laws were seriously enforced, but they appear to be a backlash against some older documents that granted things like equal compensation to both partners in divorce. The women of the king's harem and their servants were also subject to harsh punishments, such as beatings, mutilation, and death. Assyria, in general, had much harsher laws than most of the region. Executions were not uncommon, nor were whippings followed by forced labour. Some offenses allowed the accused a trial under torture/duress. One tablet that covers property rights has brutal penalties for violators. A creditor could force debtors to work for him, but not sell them.

[[File:Flaying of rebels.jpg|thumb|Assyrians skinning or [[flaying]] their prisoners alive]]

The Middle Assyrian Period is marked by the long wars fought during this period that helped build Assyria into a warrior society. The king depended on both the citizen class and priests in his capital, and the landed nobility who supplied the horses needed by Assyria's military. Documents and letters illustrate the importance of the latter to Assyrian society. Assyria needed less artificial irrigation than Babylon, and horse-breeding was extensive. Portions of elaborate texts about the care and training of them have been found. Trade was carried out in all directions. The mountain country to the north and west of Assyria was a major source of metal ore, as well as lumber. Economic factors were a common ''casus belli''.

Assyrian architecture, like that of Babylonia, was influenced by [[Sumero-Akkadian]] styles (and to some degree Mitanni), but early on developed its own distinctive style. Palaces sported colourful wall decorations, and seal-cutting (an art learned from Mittani) developed apace. Schools for scribes taught both the Babylonian and Assyrian dialects of [[Akkadian]], and [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] and [[Akkadian]] literary works were often copied with an Assyrian flavour. The Assyrian dialect of Akkadian was used in legal, official, religious, and practical texts such as medicine or instructions on manufacturing items. During the 13th to 10th centuries, picture tales appeared as a new art form: a continuous series of images carved on square stone steles. Somewhat reminiscent of a comic book, these show events such as warfare or hunting, placed in order from the upper left to the lower right corner of the stele with captions written underneath them. These and the excellent cut seals show that Assyrian art was beginning to surpass that of Babylon. Architecture saw the introduction of a new style of [[ziggurat]], with two towers and colorful enameled tiles.

==Neo-Assyrian Empire, 911–612 BC==
[[File:Map of Assyria.png|thumb|300px|Map of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its expansions.]]
{{main|Neo-Assyrian Empire|Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire}}

[[Ashur-Dan II]] (935–912 BC) oversaw a marked economic and organisational upturn in the fortunes of Assyria, laying the platform for it to once again forge an empire. He is recorded as having made successful punitive raids outside the borders of Assyria to clear [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] and other tribal peoples from the regions surrounding Assyria in all directions. He concentrated on rebuilding Assyria within its natural borders, from [[Tur Abdin]] to [[Arrapha]] ([[Kirkuk]]), he built government offices in all provinces, and created a major economic boost by providing ploughs throughout the land, which yielded record grain production.

The Neo-Assyrian Empire is usually considered to have begun with the accession of [[Adad-nirari II]], in [[911 BC]], lasting until the fall of Nineveh at the hands of the [[Babylonians|Babylonians, Chaldeans]], [[Medes|Medes/Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] in 612 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=ae_chart Chart of World Kingdoms, Nations and Empires—All Empires]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion, 911–627 BC===
When the ancient Dark Ages (which for Assyria lasted from 1050 to 936 BC) finally lifted, the world had changed dramatically. Ancient kingdoms such as Assyria, Babylonia, Elam and Egypt still endured, the Hittites did also, in the form of smaller Neo-Hittite states. A number of new states had arisen during the tumultuous time between 1200 and 936 BC, such as; Persia, Media, Parthia, Mannea, Israel, Urartu, Phrygia, Lydia, the Aramean and Phoenician states of the Levant, Doric Greece, Putria (Libya), Colchia, Tabal, Nubia/Kush. In addition, other nations and peoples; such as Chaldea, Judah, Scythia, Cimmeria, Samaria, Ethiopia, Nabatea, Armenia and the Arabs were to emerge in the following centuries.

However, it was the ancient state of Assyria which would once more rise to prominence, and Assyria was to meet and defeat these new peoples, together with old foes, over the coming three centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot; /&gt;

Beginning with the campaigns of [[Adad-nirari II]] (911-892 BC), Assyria once more became a great power, growing to be the greatest empire the world had yet seen. The new king firmly subjugated the areas that were previously only under nominal Assyrian vassalage, conquering and deporting troublesome [[Aramaeans|Aramean]], [[Neo-Hittite]] and [[Hurrian]] populations in the north to far-off places. Adad-nirari II then twice attacked and defeated [[Shamash-mudammiq]] of [[Babylonia]], annexing a large area of land north of the [[Diyala River]] and the towns of [[Hīt]] and [[Zanqu]] in mid Mesopotamia. Later in his reign, he made further gains against King [[Nabu-shuma-ukin I]] of [[Babylonia]]. He then conquered [[Kadmuh]] and [[Nisibin]] from the [[Arameans]], and secured the [[Khabur]] region.

His successor, [[Tukulti-Ninurta II]] (891–884 BC) consolidated Assyria's gains and expanded into the [[Zagros Mountains]] in modern [[Iran]], subjugating the newly arrived [[Persian people|Persians]], Parthians and [[Medes]] as well as pushing into central [[Asia Minor]].
[[File:Assyrian Attack on a Town.jpg|thumb|Assyrian attack on a town with archers and a wheeled battering ram, 865–860 BC]]
[[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883–859 BC) was a fierce and ruthless ruler who advanced without opposition through [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] and [[Canaan]] (modern [[Syria]], [[Lebannon]], [[Jordan]] and [[Israel]]) and [[Asia Minor]] as far as the [[Mediterranean]] and conquered and exacted tribute from [[Aramea]], [[Phrygia]] and [[Phoenicia]] among others. Ashurnasirpal II also repressed revolts among the [[Medes]] and [[Persia]]ns in the Zagros Mountains, and moved his capital to the city of [[Kalhu]] ([[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]). The palaces, temples and other buildings raised by him bear witness to a considerable development of wealth, science, architecture and art. He also built a number of new heavily fortified towns, such as [[Imgur-Enlil]] ([[Balawat]]), [[Tushhan]], [[Kar-Ashurnasirpal]] and [[Nibarti-Ashur]]. Ashurnasirpal II also had a keen interest in [[Botany]] and [[Zoology]]; collecting all manner of plants, seeds and animals to be displayed in Assyria.

[[Shalmaneser III]] (858–823 BC) had his authority challenged by a large alliance of a dozen nations, some of which were vassals, including; [[Babylonia]], [[Egypt]], [[Elam]], [[Persia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Hamath]], [[Phoenicia]], the [[Arabs]], [[Arameans]], [[Suteans]] and neo [[Hittites]] among others, fighting them to a standstill at the [[Battle of Qarqar]]. The failure of this alliance prevented pharaoh [[Osorkon II]] from regaining an Egyptian foothold in the Near East.

Subsequent to this, Shalmaneser III attacked and reduced [[Babylonia]] to vassalage, including subjugating the [[Chaldea]]n, [[Aramean]] and [[Sutean]] tribes settled within it. He then defeated [[Aramea]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]], [[Urartu]], [[Phoenicia]], the [[Neo-Hittite]] states and the desert dwelling [[Arabs]] of the Arabian Peninsula, forcing all of these to pay tribute to Assyria.

It is in Assyrian accounts of the 850's BC, recorded during the reign of [[Shalmaneser III]], that the [[Arab people|Arabs]] and [[Chaldea]]ns first enter the pages of written history.

His armies penetrated to [[The Caucasus]], [[Lake Van]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]]; the Hittites around Carchemish were compelled to pay tribute, and the kingdoms of [[Hamath]] and [[Aram Damascus]] were subdued. In 831 BC, he received the submission of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n kingdom of [[Tabal]]. He consolidated Assyrian control over the regions conquered by his predecessors and, by the end of his 27-year reign, Assyria was master of Mesopotamia, The Levant, western Iran, Israel, Jordan and much of Asia Minor. Due to old age, in the last 6 years of his reign he passed command of his armies to the &quot;Turtanu&quot; (General) [[Dayyan-Assur]].

However, his successor, [[Shamshi-Adad V]] (822-811 BC) (also known as [[Shamshi-Ramman II]]), inherited an empire beset by civil war in Assyria itself. The first years of his reign saw a serious struggle for the succession of the aged Shalmaneser III. The revolt, which had broken out by 826 BC, was led by Shamshi-Adad's brother [[Assur-danin-pal]]. The rebellious brother, according to Shamshi-Adad's own inscriptions, succeeded in bringing to his side 27 important cities, including [[Nineveh]] and [[Babylon]]. The rebellion lasted until 820 BC, preventing Assyria expanding its empire further until it was quelled.

Later in his reign, Shamshi-Adad V successfully campaigned against both [[Babylonia]] and [[Elam]], and forced a treaty in Assyria's favour on the Babylonian king [[Marduk-zakir-shumi I]]. In [[814 BCE]], he won the battle of [[Dur-Papsukkal]] against the new Babylonian king [[Murduk-balassu-iqbi]], and went on to subjugate the immigrant tribes of [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Arameans|Aramean]]s, and [[Sutean]]s who had recently settled in parts of [[Babylonia]].

He was succeeded by [[Adad-nirari III]] (810–782 BC), who was merely a boy. The Empire was thus ruled by his mother, the famed queen [[Semiramis]] ([[Shammuramat]]), until 806 BC. [[Semiramis]] held the empire together, and appears to have campaigned successfully in subjugating the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Parthians]] and [[Medes]] during her regency, leading to the later [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] and also [[Greeks|Greek]] myths and legends surrounding her.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p.&amp;nbsp;301–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 806 BC, [[Adad-nirari III]] took the reins of power from [[Semiramis]]. He invaded the [[Levant]] and subjugated the [[Arameans]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Philistines]], [[Israelites]], [[Neo-Hittites]], [[Moabites]] and [[Edomites]]. He entered [[Damascus]] and forced tribute upon its [[Aramaeans|Aramean]] king [[Ben-Hadad III]]. He next turned eastward to [[Iran]], and subjugated the [[Persia]]ns, [[Medes]] and the pre Iranian [[Manneans]], penetrating as far north east as the [[Caspian Sea]]. He then turned south, forcing [[Babylonia]] to pay tribute. His next targets were the migrant [[Aramean]], [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldean]] and [[Sutu, Iran|Sutu]] tribes, who had settled in the far south eastern corner of Mesopotamia, whom he conquered and reduced to vassalage. Then the [[Arabs]] in the deserts of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to the south of Mesopotamia were invaded, vanquished and forced to pay tribute also.

It is from this general period that the [[Cilician]] [[Indo-Anatolian]] term ''Surai'' ([[Syria]]) first appears in historical record in what is now called the [[Çineköy inscription]], not in reference to the region of [[Aramea]] now encompassing modern Syria in [[The Levant]], but specifically and only to Assyria itself.

Adad-nirari III died prematurely in 782 BC, which led to a temporary period of stagnation within the empire. Assyria continued its military dominance, however [[Shalmaneser IV]] (782 - 773 BC) himself seems to have wielded little personal authority, and a victory over [[Argishti I]], king of [[Urartu]] at [[Til Barsip]] is accredited to an Assyrian General ([[Turtanu]]) named [[Shamshi-ilu]], who does not even bother to mention his king. Shamshi-ilu also scored victories over the [[Arameans]], [[Phrygians]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Neo-Hittites]], and again, takes personal credit at the expense of his king.

[[Ashur-dan III]] ascended the throne in 772 BC. He proved to be a largely ineffectual ruler who was beset by internal rebellions in the cities of [[Ashur]], [[Arrapkha]] and [[Guzana]]; and his personal authority was checked by powerful generals, such as Shamshi-ilu. He failed to make any further gains in Babylonia, Canaan and [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. His reign was also marred by [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] and an ominous [[Solar Eclipse]] and, as with his predecessor, military victories were credited to Shamshi-ilu.

[[Ashur-nirari V]] became king in 754 BC, the early part of his reign seems to have been one of permanent internal revolution, and he apprears to have barely left his palace in [[Nineveh]]. However later in his reign he led a number of successful campaigns in [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Levant]]. He was deposed by [[Tiglath-pileser III]] in 745 BC bringing a resurgence to Assyrian expansion.

[[Tiglath-Pileser III]] (745–727 BC), a usurper whose original name was ''Pulu'', initiated a renewed period of Assyrian expansion; [[Urartu]], [[Persia]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Mannea]], [[Babylonia]], [[Arabia]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samaria]], [[Nabatea]], [[Chaldea]], [[Cyprus]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]] and the [[Neo-Hittites]] were subjugated, Tiglath-Pileser III was declared king in [[Babylon]] and the Assyrian empire was now stretched from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to [[Arabia]] and from the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Cyprus]]. 

Tiglath-Pileser III had reorganised the Assyrian army into the first professional fighting force in history, he also incorporated conquered peoples into the imperial army to serve as light infantry, thus expanding the size of the army. He greatly improved the civil administration of his empire, reducing the influence of hitherto powerful nobles, regional governors and viceroys, and deporting troublesome peoples to other parts of his vast empire, setting the template for all future ancient empires&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq''&lt;/ref&gt;
Tiglath-Pileser III also introduced [[Mesopotamian]] [[Eastern Aramaic]] as the ''Lingua Franca'' of Assyria and its vast empire, whose Akkadian infused descendant dialects still survive among the modern [[Assyrian Christian]] people to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shalmaneser V]] (726–723 BC) consolidated Assyrian power during his short reign, and repressed [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] attempts to gain a foothold in the near east, defeating and driving out Pharaoh [[Shoshenq V]] from the region. He is mentioned in Biblical sources as having conquered [[Israel]] the [[Samaritans]], and being responsible for deporting the [[Ten Lost Tribes of Israel]] to Assyria.

[[Sargon II]] (722–705 BC) maintained the empire, driving the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] from [[Ancient Iran]], where they had invaded and attacked the [[Persia]]ns and [[Medes]], who were vassals of Assyria. [[Deioces]], king of the Medes and Persians was then forced to pay tribute after launching a failed rebellion against Assyria. When in 720 BCE a revolt occurred in [[Canaan]] against [[Sargon II]], king Hanno sought the help of Pharaoh [[Osorkon IV]] of the 22nd Dynasty of [[Egypt]]. The Egyptian king sent a general named [[Raia (general)|Raia]] as well as troops in order to support the neighboring ally. However, the coalition was defeated in battle at [[Rafah|Raphia]]: Raia fled back to Egypt, Raphia and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] were looted and Hanno was [[Death by burning|burnt alive]] by the Assyrians.&lt;ref name=kk&gt;Kitchen, op. cit., §§&amp;nbsp;333–36;&amp;nbsp;463–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=G3412&gt;Grimal, op. cit., pp.&amp;nbsp;341–42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In 716 BCE Sargon II crossed the Sinai and amassed an army on Egypt's border. Osorkon IV personally met the Assyrian king at the &quot;[[Brook of Egypt]]&quot; (most likely [[el-Arish]]) and was forced pay tribute to Sargon II to avoid being invaded.&lt;ref name=kk/&gt; [[Mannea]], [[Cilicia]] [[Cappadocia]] and [[Commagene]] were conquered, [[Urartu]] was ravaged, and [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Arabia]], [[Cyprus]] and the famed [[Midas]] (king of [[Phrygia]]) were forced to pay tribute. His ''stele'' has been found as far west as [[Larnaca]] in [[Cyprus]]. Sargon II conquered [[Gurgum]], [[Milid]], the [[Georgian people|Georgian]] state of [[Tabal]], and all of the Neo-[[Hittites|Hittite]] kingdoms of the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Egypt]], now under a new [[Nubia]]n dynasty, once again attempted to gain ground in the region by supporting [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel's]] rebellion against the empire, however Sargon II once again crushed the uprising, and [[Piye]] was routed and driven back over the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]]. Sargon II was killed in 705 BC while on a punitive raid against the [[Cimmerians]], and was succeeded by [[Sennacherib]].

[[Sennacherib]] (705-681 BC), a ruthless ruler, defeated the [[Greeks]] who were attempting to gain a foothold in [[Cilicia]], and then defeated and drove the [[Nubia]]n ruled [[Egyptians]] from the [[Near East]] where the new Nubian Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] had once again fomented revolt against Assyria among the [[Israelites]], [[Judeans]] and [[Canaanites]].

[[Sennacherib]] was forced to contend with a major revolt within his empire, which included a large alliance of subject peoples, including [[Babylonians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Medes]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Elamites]], [[Parthians]], [[Manneans]] and [[Arameans]]. The prime movers in this rebellion were [[Mushezib-Marduk]] of Babylonia, [[Achaemenes]] of Persia, [[Khumban-umena III]] of Elam, and [[Deioces]] of Media. The [[Battle of Halule]] was fought in 691 BC between Sennacherib and his enemies,  in which this vast alliance failed to overthrow Sennacherib. The Assyrian king was then able to subjugate these nations individually, [[Babylon]] was sacked and largely destroyed by Sennacherib.

He sacked [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], subjugated the [[Samaritans]] and laid siege to [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], forcing tribute upon it. He installed his own son [[Ashur-nadin-shumi]] as king in Babylonia. He maintained Assyrian domination over the Medes, Manneans and Persians to the east, Asia Minor and the southern Caucasus to the north and north west, and the Levant, Phoenicia and Aram in the west. Sennacherib's palace and garden at Nineveh have been proposed as the archetype of the Hanging Garden of Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Dalley (2013)''The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: an elusive world Wonder traced''OUP ISBN 978-0-19-966226-5&lt;/ref&gt; Sennacherib was murdered by his own sons (according to the Bible the sons were named [[Adrammelech]], [[Abimelech]] and Sharezer) in a palace revolt, apparently in revenge for the destruction of Babylon, a city sacred to all Mesopotamians, including the Assyrians.

[[File:Lachishsiege1.PNG|right|thumb|[[Judea]]n captives being led away into slavery by the Assyrians after the [[siege of Lachish]] in 701 BC]]

[[Esarhaddon]] (680–669 BC) expanded Assyria still further, campaigning deep into the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in the north, defeating king [[Rusas II]] and breaking [[Urartu]] completely in the process. Esarhaddon campaigned successfully subjugating the [[Scythian]] king [[Ishpakaia]], and the [[Cimmerian]] king [[Teushpa]] in Asia Minor, and in Ancient Iran, the [[Manneans]], [[Gutians]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Phraortes]] the king of the [[Medes]] were subjugated.

To the west, the kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Edom]], [[Moab]], [[Israel]], [[Sidon]], [[Ekron]], [[Byblos]], [[Arvad]], [[Samarra]], [[Ammon]], [[Amalek]],  and the ten [[Greeks|Greek]] kings of [[Cyprus]], are listed as Assyrian subjects.

Tiring of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian interference in the Assyrian Empire, Esarhaddon decided to conquer Egypt. In 671 BC crossed the [[Sinai Desert]], and invaded and took [[Egypt]] with surprising ease and speed, driving its foreign [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] and [[Ethiopia]]n rulers out and destroying the [[Kushite Empire]] in the process.  Esarhaddon now declared himself &quot;king of [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], and [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]&quot;, and returned with rich booty from the cities of the delta; he erected a victory stele at this time, and paraded the captive Nubian Prince [[Ushankhuru]], the son of Taharqa in Nineveh. Esarhaddon stationed a small army in northern Egypt and describes how; &quot;All Ethiopians (read Nubians/Kushites) I deported from Egypt, leaving not one left to do homage to me&quot;.[69] He installed native Egyptian princes throughout the land to rule on his behalf.[70] The conquest by Esarhaddon effectively marked the end of the short lived Kushite Empire.

He expanded the empire as far south as [[Arabia]], [[Meluhha]] and [[Dilmun]] (modern [[Bahrain]] and [[Qatar]]).

[[Esarhaddon]] also completely rebuilt [[Babylon]] during his reign, bringing peace to Mesopotamia as a whole. The [[Babylonians]], [[Egyptians]], [[Elamites]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Manneans]], [[Arameans]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Israelites]], [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Urartu|Urartians]] were vanquished and regarded as vassals and Assyria's empire was kept secure.

He imposed a so-called ''Vassal Treaty'' upon his [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Median]] subjects, forcing [[Teispes]] of Persia and [[Deioces]] of Media to submit both to himself, and in advance to his chosen successor, Ashurbanipal.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson, Kirk A. (Autumn, 1987). &quot;Akkadian Treaties of Seventh Century BC&quot;. Journal of Cuneiform Studies 39 (2): p.130.: “... Esarhaddon imposes oaths to respect the right to succession of his two sons upon various peoples: the Medes in the Vassal Treaties and probably the people of Sippar in Text 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Esarhaddon died whilst preparing to leave for Egypt to once more eject the [[Nubians]], who were attempting to encroach on the southern part of the country. This task was successfully completed by his successor, [[Ashurbanipal]].

Under [[Ashurbanipal]] (669–627 BC), Assyrian domination spanned from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (modern [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]]) in the north to [[Nubia]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]] and [[Arabia]] in the south, and from the [[East Mediterranean]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Antioch]] in the west to [[Persia]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] in the east.

He was an unusually educated man for his time, being able to read and write in Akkadian, Aramaic and Sumerian, and having a proficient understanding of Astronomy and Mathematics, as well as military, civil and political aptitude. He built the famed [[Library of Ashurbanipal]] which contained a multitude of ancient texts from all over Mesopotamia, and was the first library in history to classify works in order of genre.
[[File:Susa-destruction.jpg|thumb|Ashurbanipal's brutal campaign against [[Elam]] in 647 BCE is recorded in this relief.]]

Ashurbanipal began his rule by easily crushing the [[Nubia]]n/[[Kingdom of Kush|Cushite]] king [[Taharqa]], who had attempted to invade the southern part of Assyrian-controlled Egypt. [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] was sacked, and [[Taharqa]] was chased back into [[Nubia]] (modern [[Sudan]]) by a pursuing Assyrian army, and was never again to pose a threat. Ashurbanipal then put down a series of rebellions by the native Egyptians themselves, installing [[Necho I]] as a puppet Pharaoh. However in 664 BC, the new Nubian-Kushite king [[Tantamani]] once more attempted to invade Egypt, however he was savagely crushed, [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] was sacked and looted, and he fled to Nubia, bringing to an end, once and for all, Nubian designs on Egypt.

[[Phraortes]], the king of the [[Medes]] and Persians, also rebelled against Assyria, and attempted to attack Assyria itself in 653 BC, however he met with defeat at the hands of Ashurbanipal, and was killed. The succeeding Median kings, [[Madius]] and then [[Cyaxares the Great]], were both in turn subjugated by Ashurbanipal.

At around this time, [[Gyges of Lydia|Gyges]] king of [[Lydia]] in western Asia Minor, offered his submission to Ashurbanipal.

In 652 BC, just one year after his victory over Phraortes, his own brother [[Shamash-shum-ukin]], the Assyrian king of [[Babylon]] who had spent seventeen years peacefully subject to his sibling, became infused with Babylonian nationalism, declaring that Babylon and not Nineveh should be the seat of empire. Shamash-shum-ukin raised a powerful coalition of peoples resentful of being subject to Assyria, including- [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldeans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Arameans]], [[Suteans]], [[Arabs]], [[Elamites]], [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]], and even some [[Assyrians]]. War raged between the two brothers for five years, until in 648 BC, Babylon was sacked, and Shamash-shum-ukin slain. Ashurbanipal then wrought savage revenge, [[Elam]] was utterly destroyed, the Aramean, Chaldean, Sutean tribes were brutally punished, [[Arabia]]  was ravaged by the Assyrian army, and its rebellious shiekhs put to death. [[Cyrus I]] of [[Persia]] (grandfather of [[Cyrus the Great]]) was forced into submission, as a part of this defeated alliance.

Late in his reign, Ashurbanipal was forced to contend with renewed attempts on his empire by the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. The Scythians were able to once more ravage Assyria's Median and Persian colonies in [[Ancient Iran]] before being finally subdued, and the last decade or so of his reign seems to have been peaceful.

He built vast libraries and initiated a surge in the building of temples and palaces. After the crushing of the Babylonian revolt, Ashurbanipal appeared master of all he surveyed. To the east, [[Elam]] was devastated and prostrate before Assyria, the [[Manneans]] and the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Persia]]ns and Medes were vassals. To the south, [[Babylonia]] was occupied, the [[Chaldean people|Chaldeans]], [[Arabs]], [[Sutu, Iran|Sutu]] and [[Nabateans]] subjugated, the [[Nubia]]n empire destroyed, and [[Egypt]] paid tribute. To the north, the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] had been vanquished and driven from Assyrian territory, [[Urartu]] ([[Armenia]]), [[Phrygia]], [[Corduene]] and the neo [[Hittites]] were in vassalage, and [[Lydia]] pleading for Assyrian protection. To the west, [[Aramea]] ([[Syria]]), the [[Phoenicians]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samarra]] and [[Cyprus]] were subjugated, and the [[Hellenised]] inhabitants of [[Caria]], [[Cilicia]], [[Cappadocia]] and [[Commagene]] paid tribute to Assyria.

Assyria conquered the [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty Egypt]] (expelling its [[Nubian people|Nubian]]/[[Kushite]] dynasty) as well as [[Babylonia]], [[Chaldea]], [[Elam]], [[Median Empire|Media]], [[Persia]], [[Urartu]] ([[Armenia]]), [[Phoenicia]], [[Aramea]]/[[Syria]], [[Phrygia]], the [[Neo-Hittites|Neo-Hittite States]], the [[Hurrian|Hurrian lands]], [[Arabia]], [[Gutium]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], [[Samarra]], [[Moab]], [[Edom]], [[Corduene]], [[Cilicia]], [[Mannea]] and parts of [[Ancient Greece]] (such as [[Cyprus]]), and defeated and/or exacted tribute from [[Scythia]], [[Crimean Peninsula|Cimmeria]], [[Lydia]], [[Nubia]], [[Ethiopia]] and others.

At its height, the Empire encompassed the whole of the modern nations of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Palestine]] and [[Cyprus]], together with large swathes of [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Turkey]], [[Sudan]], [[Libya]], [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]].

Assyria now appeared stronger than ever. However, the long struggles pacifying the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Arameans and Elamites, the exertions undertaken in keeping the Medes, Scythians, Persians, Urartians and Cimmerians subjugated, and the constant campaigning over three centuries to control and expand its vast empire in all directions, had left Assyria exhausted.

It had been drained of wealth and manpower; the devastated provinces could yield nothing to supply the needs of the imperial exchequer, it was difficult to find sufficient troops to garrison and effectively control the huge empire, and after the death of Ashurbanipal severe civil unrest broke out in Assyria itself, and the empire began to unravel.

===Downfall, 626–605 BC===
The Assyrian Empire was severely crippled following the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC—the nation and its empire descending into a prolonged and brutal series of civil wars involving three rival kings, [[Ashur-etil-ilani]], [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] and [[Sin-shar-ishkun]]. [[Egypt]]'s 26th Dynasty, which had been installed by the Assyrians as vassals, quietly detached itself from Assyria, although it was careful to retain friendly relations.

[[Ashur-etil-ilani]] came to the throne in 626 BC, and was immediately beset by a series of internal civil wars. He was deposed in 623 BC, after four years of bitter fighting by [[Sin-shumu-lishir]], an Assyrian ''Turtanu'' (General) who also occupied and claimed the throne of [[Babylon]] in that year. In turn, Sin-shumu-lishir was deposed as ruler of Assyria and Babylonia after a year of warfare by [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] (622–612 BC)—who was then himself faced with constant violent rebellion in the Assyrian homeland.

This situation led to wholesale revolution in [[Babylonia]], and during the reign of [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] many Assyrian colonies to the west, east and north similarly took advantage and ceased to pay tribute to Assyria, most significantly the [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns, [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns and [[Arameans]].

The Scythians and Cimmerians took advantage of the bitter fighting among the Assyrians to raid Assyrian colonies, with hordes of horse borne marauders ravaging parts of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], where the vassal kings of [[Urartu]] and [[Lydia]] begged their Assyrian overlord for help in vain. They also raided the [[Levant]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] (where [[Ashkelon]] was sacked by the Scythians) and all the way into [[Egypt]] whose coasts were ravaged and looted with impunity.

The [[Iranic]] peoples (the [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Parthians]]), aided by the previous Assyrian destruction of the hitherto dominant [[Elamites]] of [[Ancient Iran]], also took advantage of the upheavals in Assyria to coalesce into a powerful Median dominated force which destroyed the ''pre-Iranic'' Assyrian vassal kingdom of [[Mannea]] and absorbed the remnants of the pre-Iranic [[Elamites]] of southern Iran, and the equally pre-Iranic [[Gutians]], [[Manneans]] and [[Kassites]] of the [[Zagros Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].

In [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] (modern [[Syria]]), [[Phoenicia]] and southern [[Canaan]] (modern [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Sinai]] and [[Palestine]]), the various Aramean, Phoenician and Jewish states quietly reasserted their independence, and in western Asia Minor and eastern [[Mediterranean sea (oceanography)|Mediterranean]], the [[Lydians]], [[Greeks]], [[Cilicians]], [[Carians]], [[Cappadocia]]n and [[Luwian]] states did the same. [[Armenians]], [[Sarmatians]] and [[Colchians]] ([[Georgians]]) also began to establish themselves in parts of the Caucasus.

By 620 BC, [[Nabopolassar]], (a previously unknown ''Malka'' of the [[Chaldea]]n tribes who had settled the far southeast of [[Mesopotamia]] circa 900 BC) had claimed the city of Babylon and swathes of Babylonia in the confusion. Sin-shar-ishkun amassed a large army to eject Nabopolassar from Babylon; however, yet another massive revolt broke out in Assyria proper, forcing the bulk of his army to turn back, where they promptly joined the rebels in [[Nineveh]]. Similarly, Nabopolassar was unable to gain control over all of Babylonia, and could not make any inroads into Assyria despite its weakened state, being repelled at every attempt. The next four years saw bitter fighting in the heart of Babylonia itself, as the Assyrians tried to wrest back control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot; /&gt;

However, in 615 BC Nabopolassar entered into an alliance with the Median king [[Cyaxares the Great]], a hitherto vassal of Assyria, who had taken advantage of the upheavals in Assyria to free the Iranian peoples from Assyrian vassalage and unite the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Medes]], [[Persia]]ns and [[Parthians]], together with the remnants of the pre-Iranian [[Elamites]], [[Gutians]], [[Kassites]] and [[Manneans]], into a powerful Median-dominated force. 

Mass alliances against Assyria were not a new phenomenon.  During the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365-1020 BC), peoples such as the [[Hittites]], [[Babylonians]], [[Mitanni]], [[Hurrians]], [[Elamites]], [[Phrygians]], [[Kassites]], [[Arameans]], [[Gutians]] and [[Canaanites]] had formed various coalitions at different times in vain attempts to break Assyrian power. During the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]], in the reigns of [[Shalmaneser III]] in the 9th century BC, [[Sargon II]] in the 8th century BC, and [[Sennacherib]] and [[Ashurbanipal]] in the earlier part of the 7th century BC, combined attempts to break Assyrian dominance by alliances including at different times; [[Babylonians]], [[Egyptians]], [[Greeks]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Elamites]], [[Nubians]], [[Medes]], [[Chaldean Dynasty|Chaldeans]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Canaanites]], [[Lydians]], [[Arameans]], [[Suteans]], [[Israelites]], [[Judean]]s, [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Manneans]], [[Urartians]], [[Cilicians]], [[Neo-Hittites]] and [[Arabs]] had all failed, Assyria being strong, well led and united, at the height of its power, and able to deal with any threat. 

However the nation at this time was in a severely depleted state, ravaged by over a decade of internal civil war, disunity, instability, economic crisis and battle fatigue, and the forces ranged against it from all sides were to prove too much for the severely weakened Assyrians.

The [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Medes]] and [[Persian people|Persians]], together with the [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]] to the north, attacked Assyria in 615 BC, sacking the cities of [[Kalhu]] (Biblical [[Calah]]/[[Nimrud]]) and [[Arrapha]] ([[Kirkuk]]). In 614 BC [[Assur]], [[Guzana]] ([[Tell Halaf]]), [[Tushhan]] and [[Erbil|Arbela]] ([[Irbil]]) fell. However, during 613 Sin-shar-ishkun somehow rallied against the odds, defeating attacks by the Medes, Babylonians and Scythians.

A concerted and combined attack was launched against Assyria the following year, [[Nineveh]] itself was finally sacked in mid 612 BC, after a prolonged siege followed by fierce house to house fighting. [[Sin-shar-ishkun]] was killed defending his capital.

Despite the loss of almost all of its major cities, and in the face of overwhelming odds, Assyrian resistance continued. [[Ashur-uballit II]] (612- 605? BC) took the throne amid the street by street fighting in Nineveh, and refused a request to bow in vassalage to Nabopolassar, Cyaxares and their allies. He managed to break out of Nineveh and successfully fight his way to the northern Assyrian city of [[Harran]], he took the city and founded it as a new capital. Ashur-uballit II somehow managed to keep control of a now greatly reduced Assyria for five years, repelling attacks by his enemies. However, Harran too was eventually besieged and taken by the Medes, Babylonians and Scythians in 608 BC, with Ashur-uballit II once more managing to break free of the siege.

[[Egypt]], itself a former Assyrian colony whose current dynasty had been installed as puppet rulers by the Assyrians, then came to Assyria's aid, possibly in fear that without Assyrian protection they would be next to succumb, having already been ravaged by the Scythians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq&quot; /&gt;

[[Ashur-uballit II]] and [[Necho II|Necho]] of Egypt made a failed attempt to recapture Harran in 608 BC. The next three years saw the remnants of the Assyrian army and their Egyptian allies vainly attempting to eject the invaders from Assyria. In 605 BC, the Babylonians, Scythians and Medes-Persians defeated the Assyrians and Egyptians at [[Carchemish]], bringing an end to Assyria as an independent political entity, although it was to launch major rebellions against the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 546 BC and 520 BC, and remained a [[geo-political]] region, ethnic entity and colonised province until the late 7th century AD.

The fate of Ashur-uballit II remains unknown, his [[Limmu Lists]] end after the fall of Harran, and it is possible he was either killed at this time, at the battle of Carshemish in 605 BC, or simply disappeared into obscurity.

===Achaemenid Assyria, Athura, Assuristan, Assyria province, Adiabene, Osroene and Hatra===
Most of Assyria was ruled by [[Babylon]] from 605 BC until 539 BC, the northern reaches being ruled first by the [[Medes]] and then from 549 BC by their successors, the [[Persian People|Persians]]. In a twist of fate, [[Nabonidus]] the last king of Babylon (together with his son and co-regent [[Belshazzar]]) was himself an Assyrian from [[Harran]] who had overthrown the short lived [[Chaldea]]n dynasty in Babylonia, after which the Chaldeans disappeared from history, being fully absorbed into the native population of Babylonia. However, apart from plans to dedicate religious temples in the city of Harran, Nabonidus showed little interest in rebuilding Assyria. [[Nineveh]] and [[Kalhu]] remained in ruins, conversely a number of towns and cities such as [[Arrapkha]], [[Guzana]] and [[Harran]] remained intact, and [[Assur]] and [[Arbil|Arbela]] ([[Irbil]]) were not completely destroyed, as is attested by their later revival. However, Assyria spent much of this period in a degree of devastation following its fall.

====[[Achaemenid Assyria]] (549–330 BC)====
After this, it was ruled by the [[Persia]]n [[Achaemenid Empire]] (as [[Athura]]) from 549 BC to 330 BC (see [[Achaemenid Assyria]]). Between 546 and 545 BC, Assyria rebelled against the new Persian Dynasty, which had usurped the previous Median dynasty. The rebellion was eventually quashed by [[Cyrus the Great]].

Assyria seems to have recovered dramatically, and flourished during this period. It became a major agricultural and administrative centre of the Achaemenid Empire, and its soldiers were a mainstay of the Persian Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html |title=Assyrians after Assyria|publisher=Nineveh.com |date=4 September 1999 |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110714183623/http://www.nineveh.com/Assyrians%20after%20Assyria.html| archivedate= 14 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Assyria even became powerful enough to raise another full-scale revolt against the Persian empire in 520–519 BC.

The Persians had spent centuries under Assyrian domination (their first ruler [[Achaemenes]], having been a vassal of Assyria), and Assyrian influence can be seen in Achaemenid art, infrastructure and administration. Early Persian rulers saw themselves as successors to [[Ashurbanipal]], and [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] was retained as the ''lingua franca'' of the empire for over two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;Van de Mieroop, ''History'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nineveh]] was never rebuilt however, and 200 years after it was sacked [[Xenophon]] reported only small numbers of Assyrians living amongst its ruins. Conversely the ancient city of [[Assur]] once more became a rich and prosperous entity.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, John (November 2003). &quot;The Achaemenid Period in Northern Iraq&quot;. L’archéologie de l’empire achéménide (Paris, France): 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Seleucid Assyria====
In 330 BC, Assyria fell to [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Emperor from [[Greece]]; it thereafter became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] and was renamed [[Syria]], a [[Hurrian]], [[Luwian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] corruption of '''Assyria''', a term which for many centuries until the Seleucid era had only and specifically meant and referred to Assyria and the Assyrians, and not to The Levant and its largely Aramean, Phoenician and Neo-Hittite inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf |title=The Terms &quot;Assyria&quot; and &quot;Syria&quot; Again|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 June 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110613170304/http://www.aina.org/articles/ttaasa.pdf| archivedate= 13 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is from this period that the later [[Name of Syria|''Syria'' Vs ''Assyria'' naming controversy arises]], the Seleucids applied the name not only to Assyria itself, but also to the lands to the west ([[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]] modern [[Syria]]), which had been part of the Assyrian empire. When they lost control of Assyria, the name ''Syria'' survived but was applied only to the land of [[Aramea]] (also known as [[Eber Nari]]) to the west that had once been part of the Assyrian empire, but apart from the north eastern corner, had never been a part of Assyria itself, nor inhabited by Assyrians. This was to lead to both the Assyrians from Northern Mesopotamia and the Arameans and Phoenicians from the Levant being collectively dubbed '''Syrians''' (and later also '''Syriacs''') in [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] culture, regardless of ethnicity, history or geography.

During Seleucid rule, Assyrians ceased to hold the senior military and civil positions they had enjoyed under the Achaemenids, being largely replaced by Greeks. The Greek language also replaced Mesopotamian East Aramaic as the lingua franca of the empire, although this did not affect the Assyrian population themselves, who were not Hellenised during the Seleucid era.

During the Seleucid period in southern Mesopotamia, [[Babylon]] was gradually abandoned in favour of a new city named [[Dura Seleucus]], bringing an end to ''Babylonia''.

====Parthian Assyria (150 BC – 116 AD); [[Adiabene]] (69 BC – 117 AD)====
By 150 BC, Assyria was largely under the control of the [[Parthian Empire]], once more as [[Athura]] (the Mesopotamian East Aramaic word for Assyria). The Parthians seem to have exercised only loose control over Assyria. Temples to the native gods of Assyria were resurrected in many towns and cities. A number of independent [[Neo-Assyrian]] states arose, the most notable being [[Adiabene]] (69 BC - 117 AD). Adiabene was described by historian [[Georges Roux]] as a virtual resurrection of Assyria.

The Assyrians began to convert to [[Christianity]] from [[Mesopotamian religion]] ([[Ashurism]]) during the period between the early 1st and 3rd centuries AD.

====Roman Assyria (116 AD – 118 AD)====
However, in 116 AD, under [[Trajan]], Assyria and its independent states were taken over by Rome as the [[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Province of Assyria]]. Adiabene was destroyed as an independent state during this period. Roman rule lasted only a few years, and the Parthians once more regained control.
However, a number of Assyrians were conscripted into the [[Roman Army]], with many serving in the region of [[Hadrians Wall]] in [[Ancient Britain]], and inscriptions in Aramaic made by [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] and [[Aramean]] soldiers have been discovered in northern [[England]] dating from the 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theguardian.com/culture/charlottehigginsblog/2009/oct/13/hadrians-wall&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parthian Assyria restored (119 AD – 225 AD), [[Osroene]], [[Hatra]]====
[[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Parthians]] fought over Assyria and the rest of Mesopotamia for the next century, allowing a number of other Neo-Assyrian states to arise, namely [[Osroene]] (132 BC to AD 244) and [[Hatra]] (155–241 AD). Osroene became the first [[Christian]] state in history, and a major center of [[Syriac literature]] and [[Syriac Christianity]].

In addition, the ancient capital city of [[Ashur]] again flourished, and appears to have gained independence during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. Temples to the Assyrian national gods [[Ashur]], [[Sin]], [[Hadad]], [[Ishtar]] and [[Shamash]] were once more dedicated throughout Assyria during this period. The noted Assyriologist [[Simo Parpola]] has speculated that Assyria may well have once again been fully independent for a while.

====Sassanid Assyria ([[Assuristan]] (226 AD – circa 650 AD)====
In 226 AD, Assyria was largely taken over by the [[Sassanid Empire]]. After driving out the Romans and Parthians, the Sassanid rulers set about destroying the independent states within Assyria; Hatra was dissolved in 241 AD, Osroene in 244 AD and Assur was sacked by [[Shapur I]] in 256 AD.

It was known as [[Asuristan]] (the Sassanid name for Assyria) during this period, and became the birthplace of the [[Church of the East]] (now split into the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]), with a flourishing [[Syriac]] ([[Assyrian people|Assyrian]]) Christian culture which exists there to this day. Temples were still being dedicated to the national god [[Ashur]] in his home city and in [[Harran]] during the 4th century, indicating an Assyrian identity was still strong.

During the Sassanid period, much of what had once been [[Babylonia]] in southern Mesopotamia was incorporated into Assyria.

Parts of Assyria appear to have been semi independent as late as the latter part of the 4th century AD, with a king named [[Sennacherib II]] ruling the northern reaches in 370s AD.

==Assyrians after Assyria==
{{see also|Assyrian continuity|Assyrian People}}
Centuries of constant warfare between the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Sassanid Empire]] left both empires exhausted, depleted and battle fatigued, allowing the Muslim Arabs to break from the [[Arabian peninsula]] and invade territories hitherto held by these empires. After the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th century, Assyria was dissolved as an entity, although the native Assyrian population still regarded the region as [[Athura]], an appellation which survived until the 19th century AD. Under Arab rule, Mesopotamia as a whole underwent a gradual process of [[Arabisation]] and [[Islamification]], and the region saw a gradual large influx of ''non indigenous'' [[Arab people|Arabs]], [[Kurds]] [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] and [[Turkic peoples]]. However, the indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] population of northern Mesopotamia (known as [[Ashuriyun]] by the Arabs) resisted this process, retaining their language, religion, culture and identity.

The previously basic civilisation of the desert dwelling Arabs was greatly enhanced and enriched by the influence and knowledge of native Mesopotamian scientists, physicians, mathematicians, theologians, astronomers, architects, agriculturalists, artists and astrologers.
[[File:Syriac Christianity.svg|thumb|Aramaic language and [[Syriac Christianity]] in the Middle East and Central Asia until being largely annihilated by [[Tamerlane]] in the 14th century.]]

However, despite this, indigenous Assyrians became second class citizens in a greater Arab Islamic state, and those who resisted Arabisation and conversion to Islam were subject to religious, ethnic and cultural discrimination, and had certain restrictions imposed upon them.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Bennett (2005). Muslims and Modernity: An Introduction to the Issues and Debates. Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 163. ISBN 082645481X. Retrieved 2012-07-07&lt;/ref&gt; They were excluded from specific duties and occupations reserved for Muslims, did not enjoy the same political rights as Muslims, their word was not equal to that of a Muslim in legal and civil matters, as Christians they were subject to payment of a special tax ([[jizyah]]), they were banned from spreading their religion further in Muslim ruled lands, men were banned from marrying Muslim women, but at he same time they were also expected to adhere to the same laws of property, contract and obligation as the Muslim Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;H. Patrick Glenn, Legal Traditions of the World. Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although predominantly Christian, a minority of Assyrians still held onto their ancient Mesopotamian religion until as late as the 10th century AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;nineveh.com&quot;&gt;http://www.nineveh.com/parpola_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrian people, still retaining [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] infused and influenced [[Eastern Aramaic]] and [[Assyrian Church of the East]] [[Christianity]], remained dominant in the north of Mesopotamia (what had been Assyria) as late as the 14th century AD&lt;ref&gt;According to Georges Roux and Simo Parpola&lt;/ref&gt; and the city of [[Assur]] was still occupied by Assyrians during the Islamic period until the mid-14th century when the [[Muslim]] Turco-Mongol ruler [[Tamurlane]] conducted a religiously motivated massacre of indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]]. After that, there are no traces of a settlement at Ashur in the archaeological and numismatic record, and from this point the Assyrian population was dramatically reduced in their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assur.de/Themen/Stadtgeschichte_Engl/body_stadtgeschichte_engl.html |title=History of Ashur |publisher=Assur.de |date= |accessdate=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A religious [[schism]] among the Assyrians of northern Mesopotamia emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries AD, when a large number of hitherto [[Assyrian Church of the East]] Assyrians from the far north of Mesopotamia entered communion with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] after becoming dissatisfied with the [[Abuna]] family's leadership of the Assyrian Church, and after at first failing to gain acceptance within the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]. Rome named this new church ''The Church of Assyria and Mosul'' and its first leader ''Patriarch of the East Assyrians'' in 1553 AD. However in 1683 AD, Rome altered the name to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], this group of Assyrians eventually became known as [[Chaldean Catholics]] or [[Chaldo-Assyrians]] despite having no ethnic, historical, linguistic or geographic connections whatsoever to the long extinct Chaldean tribe of south east Mesopotamia.

The Assyrians suffered a number of religiously and ethnically motivated massacres throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries AD,&lt;ref&gt;Aboona, H (2008). Assyrians and Ottomans: intercommunal relations on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. Cambria Press. pp. 218–219. ISBN 978-1-60497-583-3.&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in the large scale [[Hamidian massacres]] of unarmed men, women and children by [[Muslim]] [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Kurds]] in the late 19th century, which further greatly reduced numbers, particularly in southeastern Turkey.

[[File:Burning of Assyrians.jpg|thumb|The burning of bodies of Christian Assyrian women]]
The Assyrians suffered a further catastrophic series of massacres known as the [[Assyrian Genocide]], at the hands of the [[Ottomans]] and their [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] and [[Arab]] allies from 1915–1918. The genocide accounted for up to 300,000 unarmed Assyrian civilians, and the forced deportations of many more. The sizeable Assyrian presence in south eastern Asia Minor which had endured for over four millennia was reduced to a few thousand. As a consequence, the surviving Assyrians took up arms, and an [[Assyrian war of independence]] was fought during [[World War I]], For a time, the Assyrians fought successfully against overwhelming numbers, scoring a number of victories over the Ottomans and Kurds, and also hostile Arab and Iranian groups; then their [[Russia]]n allies left the war following the [[Russian Revolution]], and [[Armenia]]n resistance broke. The Assyrians were left cut off, surrounded, and without supplies, forcing those in Asia Minor and Northwest Iran to fight their way, with civilians in tow, to the safety of [[United Kingdom|British]] lines and their fellow Assyrians in northern Iraq.

The [[Assyrian Levies]] were founded by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings, such as [[Rab-shakeh]], [[Rab-talia]] and Tartan, being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline, and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds, guard the borders with Iran and Turkey and protect British military installations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Len Deighton]] (1993), ''[[Blood, Tears and Folly]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

After Iraq was granted independence by the British in 1933, the Assyrians suffered the [[Simele Massacre]], where thousands of unarmed villagers (men, women and children) were slaughtered by joint Arab-Kurdish forces of the Iraqi Army. These massacres followed a clash between Assyrian tribesmen and the Iraqi army, where the Iraqi forces suffered a defeat after trying to disarm the Assyrians, whom they feared would attempt to secede from Iraq. Armed Assyrian Levies were prevented by the British from going to the aid of these civilians.

The Assyrians were allied with the British during [[World War II]], with eleven Assyrian companies seeing action in [[Palestine]]/[[Israel]] and another four serving in [[Cyprus]]. The Parachute Company was attached to the Royal Marine Commando and was involved in fighting in [[Albania]], [[Italy]] and [[Greece]]. Assyrians played a major role in the victory over Arab-Iraqi forces at the [[Battle of Habbaniya]] in 1941, when the Iraqi government decided to join WW2 on the side of [[Nazi Germany]]. The British presence in Iraq lasted until 1954, and Assyrian Levies remained attached to British forces until this time.

The period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians. The regime of President Kassim in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, others were well represented in politics and the military, their towns and villages flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel, and be over represented in sports such as Boxing, Football, Athletics, Wrestling and Swimming.
[[File:Assyrian wedding, Mechelen.jpg|thumb|180px|Assyrian wedding, diaspora in Belgium]]

However in 1963, the [[Ba'ath Party]] took power by force in Iraq. The Baathists, though secular, were [[Arab Nationalists]], and set about attempting to ''Arabize'' the many non Arab peoples of Iraq, including the Assyrians. Other ethnic groups targeted for forced ''Arabization'' included [[Kurds]], [[Armenians]], [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turcomans]], [[Mandeans]], [[Yezidi]], [[Shabaki]], [[Kawliya]], [[Persian people|Persians]] and [[Circassians]]. This policy included refusing to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group, banning the publication of written material in Eastern Aramaic, and banning its teaching in schools, banning parents giving Assyrian names to their children, banning Assyrian political parties, taking control of Assyrian churches, attempting to divide Assyrians on denominational lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox) and forced relocations of Assyrians from their traditional homelands to major cities.

In response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the [[Zowaa]] movement within the [[Assyrian Democratic Movement]] took up armed struggle against the Iraqi regime in 1982 under the leadership of [[Yonadam Kanna]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zowaa.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and then joined up with the [[Iraqi-Kurdistan Front|IKF]] in early 1990s. Yonadam Kanna in particular was a target of the [[Saddam Hussein]] Ba'ath regime for many years.

The policies of the Bathists have also long been mirrored in Turkey, whose governments have refused to acknowledge the Assyrians as an ethnic group since the 1920s, and have attempted to ''Turkify'' the Assyrians by calling them ''Semitic Turks'' and forcing them to adopt Turkic names. In Syria too, the Assyrian/Syriac Christians have faced pressure to identify as ''Arab Christians''.

Many persecutions have befallen the Assyrians since, such as the [[Anfal]] campaign and [[Baathist]], Arab and Kurdish nationalist and [[Islamist]] persecutions.

In recent years, the Assyrians in Iraq and Syria have become the target of extreme unprovoked [[Islamic terrorism]]. As a result, Assyrians taken up arms, alongside other groups (such as the Kurds, Turcomans and Armenians) in response to unprovoked attacks by [[Al Qaeda]], [[ISIS]]/[[ISIL]] and other terrorist [[Islamic Fundamentalist]] groups. In 2014 Islamic terrorists of ISIS attacked Assyrian towns and villages in the [[Assyrian Homeland]] of northern Iraq, together with cities such as [[Mosul]] and [[Kirkuk]] which have large Assyrian populations. There have been reports of atrocities committed by ISIS terrorists since, including; beheadings, crucifixions, child murders, rape, forced conversions, [[Ethnic Cleansing]], robbery, and extortion in the form of illegal taxes levied upon non Muslims.

Thus far, the only people who have been attested with a high level of genetic, historical, linguistic and cultural research to be the descendants of the ancient Mesopotamians are the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]] of [[Iraq]] and its surrounding areas in north west [[Iran]], north east [[Syria]] and south eastern [[Turkey]], although others have made unsubstantiated claims of continuity. Assyria continued to exist as a geopolitical entity until the Arab-Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century, and Assyrian identity, personal, family and tribal names, and both spoken and written evolutions of [[Mesopotamian]] [[Aramaic]] (which still contain many [[Akkadian]] loan words and an Akkadian grammatical structure) have survived among the Assyrian people from ancient times to this day. (see [[Assyrian people]]).

==Assyrian religion==
The Assyrians, like the rest of the Mesopotamian peoples, followed the [[Sumero-Akkadian]] [[Mesopotamian Religion]], with the national god [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] having pride of place at the head of the pantheon. This religion survived in Assyria from c. 3500 BC through to its gradual decline in the face of Christianity between the 1st and 10th centuries AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;nineveh.com&quot;/&gt;

Other major gods within the pantheon were [[Anu]], [[Baal]], [[Ea (Babylonian god)|Ea]], [[Enlil]], [[Ishtar]] ([[Astarte]]), [[Shamash]], [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adad]]/[[Hadad]], [[Sin (mythology)|Sin (Nanna)]], [[Dagon|Dagan]], [[Ninurta]], [[Nisroch]], [[Nergal]], [[Tiamat]], [[Ninlil]], [[Mullissu]], [[Zababa]] and [[El (deity)|El]].

Native religion was still strongly followed at least until the 4th century AD, and survived in pockets until at least the 10th century AD,&lt;ref name=&quot;nineveh.com&quot;/&gt; although Assyrians had begun to adopt [[East Syrian Rite|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]] (as well as for a time [[Manicheanism]] and [[Gnosticism]]) which, like [[Syriac]] literature, had its birthplace in Assyria between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD. Assyrians today are exclusively [[Christian]], with most following the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]] and [[Syriac Orthodox]] churches.

==Language==
During the 3rd millennium BC, a very intimate cultural symbiosis developed between the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Akkadian language|Akkad]]ians, which included widespread [[wikt:bilingualism|bilingualism]].&lt;ref name='Deutscher'&gt;{{cite book|title=Syntactic Change in Akkadian: The Evolution of Sentential Complementation|author=Deutscher, Guy|authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford University Press US]]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-19-953222-3|pages=20–21|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XFwUxmCdG94C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] on [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence.&lt;ref name='Deutscher'/&gt; This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC as a ''[[sprachbund]]''.&lt;ref name='Deutscher'/&gt;

[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate),&lt;ref name=&quot;woods&quot;/&gt; but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD.

In ancient times, Assyrians spoke a dialect of the [[Akkadian language]], an eastern branch of the [[Semitic languages]]. The first inscriptions, called Old Assyrian (OA), were made in the Old Assyrian period.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; In the Neo-Assyrian period the [[Aramaic language]] became increasingly common,&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 308&lt;/ref&gt; more so than [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]—this was thought to be largely due to the mass deportations undertaken by Assyrian kings,&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382&quot;&gt;Georges Roux (1964), ''Ancient Iraq'', p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; in which large Aramaic-speaking populations, conquered by the Assyrians, were relocated to Assyria and interbred with the Assyrians. The ancient Assyrians also used the [[Sumerian language]] in their literature and liturgy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382&quot;/&gt; although to a more limited extent in the Middle- and Neo-Assyrian periods, when Akkadian became the main literary language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382&quot;/&gt;

The destruction of the Assyrian capitals of Nineveh and Assur by the Babylonians, Medes and their allies, ensured that much of the bilingual elite (but not all) were wiped out. By the 7th century BC, much of the Assyrian population used Akkadian influenced Eastern Aramaic and not Akkadian itself. The last Akkadian inscriptions in Mesopotamia date from the 1st century AD. However, Eastern Aramaic dialects, as well as Akkadian and Mesopotamian Aramaic personal and family names, still survive to this day among [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] in the regions of northern [[Iraq]], southeast [[Turkey]], northwest [[Iran]] and northeast [[Syria]] that constituted old Assyria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq p382&quot;/&gt;

After 90 years of effort, the [[University of Chicago]] has published an Assyrian Dictionary, whose form is more [[encyclopedia]] in style than [[dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110604/ap_on_re_us/us_postcard_the90_year_dictionary_project |title=Ancient world dictionary finished—after 90 years|agency= Associated Press |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=4 June 2011 |accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Transport of cedar Dur Sharrukin.jpg|thumb|Relief from Assyrian capital of [[Dur Sharrukin]], showing transport of Lebanese cedar (8th century BC)]]
Assyrian art preserved to the present day predominantly dates to the Neo-Assyrian period. Art depicting battle scenes, and occasionally the impaling of whole villages in gory detail, was intended to show the power of the emperor, and was generally made for propaganda purposes. These stone reliefs lined the walls in the royal palaces where foreigners were received by the king. Other stone reliefs depict the king with different deities and conducting religious ceremonies. Many stone reliefs were discovered in the royal palaces at [[Nimrud]] (Kalhu) and [[Khorsabad]] (Dur-Sharrukin). A rare discovery of metal plates belonging to wooden doors was made at [[Balawat]] ([[Imgur-Enlil]]).

[[File:S03 06 01 017 image 2350.jpg|thumbnail|Assyria. Head of winged bull, 9th c. B.C.; Brooklyn Museum Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
Assyrian sculpture reached a high level of refinement in the Neo-Assyrian period. One prominent example is the winged bull ''Lamassu'', or [[shedu]] that guard the entrances to the king's court. These were apotropaic meaning they were intended to ward off evil. C. W. Ceram states in ''The March of Archaeology'' that ''lamassi'' were typically sculpted with five legs so that four legs were always visible, whether the image were viewed frontally or in profile.

Although works of precious gems and metals usually do not survive the ravages of time, some fine pieces of Assyrian jewelry were found in royal tombs at Nimrud.

There is ongoing discussion among academics over the nature of the [[Nimrud lens]], a piece of [[quartz]] unearthed by [[Austen Henry Layard]] in 1850, in the Nimrud palace complex in northern [[Iraq]]. A small minority believe that it is evidence for the existence of ancient Assyrian telescopes, which could explain the great accuracy of [[Assyrian astronomy]]. Other suggestions include its use as a magnifying glass for jewellers, or as a decorative furniture inlay. The Nimrud Lens is held in the British Museum.&lt;ref name = &quot;Muſeum&quot;&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369215&amp;partid=1 Lens], British Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assyrians were also innovative in military technology, with the use of heavy cavalry, sappers, siege engines etc.

[[File:Layard Nineveh.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Austen Henry Layard]] in Nineveh, 1852]]
[[Achaemenid]] Assyria (539–330 BC) retained a separate identity ([[Athura]]), official correspondence being in [[Imperial Aramaic]], and there was even a determined revolt of the two Assyrian provinces of Mada and Athura in 520 BC. Under [[Seleucid]] rule (330 BC – approximately 150 BC), however, [[Aramaic]] gave way to [[Greek language|Greek]] as the official administrative language. Aramaic was marginalised as an official language, but remained spoken in both Assyria and Babylonia by the general populace. It also remained the spoken tongue of the indigenous Assyrian/Babylonian citizens of all Mesopotamia under Persian, Greek and Roman rule, and indeed well into the [[Arab]] period it was still the language of the majority, particularly in the north of Mesopotamia, surviving to this day among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] Christians.

Between 150 BC and 226 AD, Assyria changed hands between the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] Iranians and Romans ([[Assyria (Roman province)|Roman Province of Assyria]]) until coming under the rule of [[Sassanid]] Persia in 226–651 AD, where it was known as [[Asuristan]].

A number of at least partly neo-Assyrian kingdoms existed in the area between in the late classical and early Christian period also; [[Adiabene]], [[Hatra]] and [[Osroene]].

[[Mesopotamia in Classical literature|Classical historiographers]] and Biblical writers had only retained a fragmented, very dim and often inaccurate picture of Assyria. It was remembered that there had been an Assyrian empire predating the Persian one, but all particulars were lost. Thus Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' lists 36 kings of the Assyrians, beginning with [[Ninus]], son of [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]], down to [[Sardanapalus]], the last king of the Assyrians before the empire fell to [[Arbaces]] the Median. Almost none of these have been substantiated as historical, with the exception of the Neo-Assyrian and Babylonian rulers listed in [[Ptolemy's Canon]], beginning with [[Nabonassar]].

Mesopotamian empires such as the Akkadian Empire, Babylonian Empire, Middle Assyrian Empire, Neo Assyrian Empire and Neo Babylonian Empire asserted Mesopotamian dominance from the [[Caucasus Mountains]] to [[Arabia]] and [[Egypt]], and from [[Cyprus]] and the east [[Mediterranean]] to [[Persia]]. Thus the influence exerted by the Babylonian-Assyrian religion was particularly profound on other [[Semites]], including the [[Hebrews]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Canaanites]], [[Arameans]], [[Phoenicians]] and [[Arabs]], while their astral theology affected the ancient world in general, including the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]] and the later [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. The impetus to the purification of the old [[Semitic]] [[polytheistic religions]] to which the [[Hebrews]] for a long time clung in common with their fellows—the various branches of nomadic [[Arameans]] and [[Arabs]]—was largely furnished by the remarkable civilization unfolded in the Euphrates valley and in many of the traditions, myths and legends embodied in the Old Testament; traces of direct adaptation from and responses to Babylonia and Assyria may be discerned, while the indirect influences in the domain of the prophetical books, as also in the [[Psalms]] and in the so-called &quot;wisdom literature&quot;, are even more noteworthy. Stories in the [[Tanakh]], [[Old Testament]] and [[Quran]] such as; the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] [[creation narrative]], [[Tower of Babel]], [[The Great Flood]] and the book of [[Esther]], as well as various biblical characters such as [[Noah]], [[Nimrod]], [[Lilith]] and [[Asnapper]] bear clear influence from Assyria and Babylonia.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Jaynes (2000). The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Mariner Books. Retrieved 2013-06-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georges Contenau La Magie chez les Assyriens et les Babyloniens, Paris, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Stephen L. (2002). Understanding the Bible. McGraw-Hill. pp. 50–51.ISBN 9780767429160&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when we reach the [[New Testament]] period, we have not passed entirely beyond the sphere of Babylonian-Assyrian influences. In such a movement as early [[Christian]] [[gnosticism]], Assyrio-Babylonian elements—modified, to be sure, and transformed—are largely present, while the growth of an apocalyptic literature is ascribed with apparent justice by many scholars to the recrudescence of views, the ultimate source of which is to be found in the astral-theology of the Babylonian and Assyrian Priests.

The Assyrians began to form and adopt a distinct [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Rite]] [[Christianity]], with its accompanying [[Syriac literature]], between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, however native religion was still alive and well into the 4th century AD, and pockets survived into the 10th century AD and possibly as late as the 17th century in Mardin. However, the religion is now dead, and the indigenous Assyrian (a.k.a. Chaldo-Assyrian) people, though still retaining Eastern Aramaic dialects as a mother tongue, are now wholly Christian.

The [[modern discovery of Babylonia and Assyria]] begins with excavations in [[Nineveh]] in 1845, which revealed the [[Library of Ashurbanipal]]. Decipherment of [[cuneiform]] was a formidable task that took more than a decade; but, by 1857, the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] was convinced that reliable reading of cuneiform texts was possible. [[Assyriology]] has since pieced together the formerly largely forgotten history of Mesopotamia. In the wake of the archaeological and philological [[rediscovery of ancient Assyria]], [[Assyrian nationalism]] became increasingly popular among the surviving remnants of the [[Assyrian people]], and has come to strongly identify with ancient Assyria.

'''Edward Mitchell Bannister''' (ca. 1828 – January 9, 1901) was a [[Black Canadian]]-[[United States|American]] [[tonalism|Tonalist]] [[Painting|painter]]. Like other Tonalists, his style and predominantly pastoral subject matter were drawn from his admiration for [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]] and the French [[Barbizon School]].

==Biography==
[[File:Edward Mitchell Bannister - Landscape - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb||Landscape ]]
Bannister was born in [[St. Andrews, New Brunswick]] and moved to [[New England]] in the late 1840s, where he remained for the rest of his life. While Bannister was well known in the artistic community of his adopted home of [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and admired within the wider East Coast art world (he won a bronze medal for his large oil &quot;Under the Oaks&quot; at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition|Philadelphia Centennial]]), he was largely forgotten for almost a century for a complexity of reasons, principally connected with racial prejudice.

With the ascendency of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights movement]] in the 1970s, his work was again celebrated and collected. In 1978, [[Rhode Island College]] dedicated its Art Gallery in Bannister's name with the exhibition: &quot;Four From Providence ~ Alston, Bannister, Jennings &amp; Prophet&quot;. This event was attended and commented on by numerous notable political figures of the time, and supported by the Rhode Island Committee for Humanities and the Rhode Island Historical Society. Events like this, across the entire cultural landscape, have ensured that his artwork and life will not be again forgotten.

Although primarily known for his idealised [[Landscape art|landscapes]] and seascapes, Bannister also executed [[portrait]]s, biblical and mythological scenes, and [[Genre works|genre]] scenes. An intellectual [[autodidacticism|autodidact]], his tastes in literature were typical of an educated [[Victorian era|Victorian]] painter, including [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], [[Virgil]], [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]] and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], from whose works much of his iconography can be traced.

Bannister died of a heart attack in 1901 while attending a prayer meeting at his church, Elmwood Avenue Free Baptist Church. He is buried in the [[North Burial Ground]] in Providence.

==Legacy==
The historian Anne Louise Avery is currently compiling the first Catalogue Raisonné of Bannister's work. See the [http://ifar.org/cat_rais.php International Foundation for Art Research] for further details.

E. M. Bannister Gallery at [[Rhode Island College]] is named after Bannister.&lt;ref name= &quot;gallbio&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url= http://www.ric.edu/bannister/about_emb.php |title=Edward Mitchell Bannister |work=[[Rhode Island College]] |date= |accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chuck D. Slakthuset i Malmö 1991.jpg|thumb|Chuck D. [[Malmö]] 1991.]]

== Early life ==
Ridenhour was born in [[Queens|Queens, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/chuck-d/|title=Chuck D biography|work=MTV Artists|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School]], he went to [[Adelphi University]] on [[Long Island]] to study [[graphic design]].  He received a B.F.A. from Adelphi in 1984 and later received an honorary doctorate from Adelphi in 2013. He is the son of Lorenzo Ridenhour.

== Career ==
Upon hearing Ridenhour's [[Demo (music)|demo track]] &quot;Public Enemy Number One&quot;, fledgling producer/upcoming music-mogul [[Rick Rubin]] insisted on signing him to his [[Def Jam]] [[Record Label|label]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1795958,00.html|title=Hip-hop, you don't stop|work=the Guardian|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their major label  albums were ''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]'' ([[1987 in music|1987]]), ''[[It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back]]'' ([[1988 in music|1988]]), ''[[Fear of a Black Planet]]'' ([[1990 in music|1990]]), ''[[Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black]]'' ([[1991 in music|1991]]), ''[[Greatest Misses]]'' ([[1992 in music|1992]]), and ''[[Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age]]'' ([[1994 in music|1994]]).  They also released a [[He Got Game (soundtrack)|full length album soundtrack]] for the film ''[[He Got Game]]'' in 1998. Ridenhour also contributed (as Chuck D) to several episodes of the [[PBS]] [[Television documentary|documentary]] series ''[[The Blues]]''. He has appeared as a featured artist on many other songs and albums, having collaborated with artists such as [[Janet Jackson]], [[Kool Moe Dee]], [[The Dope Poet Society]], [[Run–D.M.C.]], [[Ice Cube]], [[Boom Boom Satellites]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[John Mellencamp]] and many others. In 1990, he appeared on &quot;[[Kool Thing]]&quot;, a song by the [[alternative rock]] band [[Sonic Youth]], and along with [[Flavor Flav]], he sang on [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]'s song &quot;Tweakin'&quot;, which appears on his 1989 album ''[[The Cinderella Theory]]''. In 1993, he executive produced ''Got 'Em Running Scared'', an album by [[Ichiban Records]] group Chief Groovy Loo and the Chosen Tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Chief+Groovy+Loo+And+The+Chosen+Tribe |title=Chief Groovy Loo And The Chosen Tribe |publisher=Discogs.com |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later career ==
In 1996, Ridenhour released ''[[Autobiography of Mistachuck]]'' on [[Mercury Records]]. Chuck D made a rare appearance at the [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], presenting the [[Video Vanguard Award]] to the [[Beastie Boys]], whilst commending their musicianship. In November 1998, he [[settlement (law)|settled out of court]] with Christopher &quot;[[The Notorious B.I.G.]]&quot; Wallace's estate over the latter's [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] of his voice in the song &quot;Ten Crack Commandments&quot;.

In September 1999, he launched a multi-format &quot;supersite&quot; on the web site [http://www.rapstation.com Rapstation.com]. A home for the vast global hip hop community, the site boasts a TV and radio station with original programming, many of hip hop's most prominent DJs, celebrity interviews, free [[MP3]] downloads (the first was contributed by multi-platinum rapper [[Coolio]]), downloadable [[ringtone]]s by [[ToneThis]], social commentary, current events, and regular features on turning rap careers into a viable living.  Since 2000, he has been one of the most vocal supporters of [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] in the music industry.

He loaned his voice to ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' as DJ Forth Right MC for the radio station [[Playback FM]].  In 2000, he collaborated with Public Enemy's Gary G-Whiz and MC Lyte on the theme music to the television show ''[[Dark Angel (TV series)|Dark Angel]]''.  He appeared with [[Henry Rollins]] in a cover of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]'s &quot;Rise Above&quot; for the album ''[[Rise Above: 24 Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West Memphis Three]]''. He was also featured on [[Z-Trip]]'s album ''[[Shifting Gears (DJ Z-Trip album)|Shifting Gears]]'' on a track called &quot;Shock and Awe&quot;; a 12-inch of the track was released featuring artwork by [[Shepard Fairey]]. In 2008 he contributed a chapter to ''Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture'' (The MIT Press, 2008) edited by Paul D. Miller a.k.a. [[DJ Spooky]], and also turned up on [[The Go! Team]]'s album ''[[Proof of Youth]]'' on the track &quot;Flashlight Fight.&quot; He also fulfilled his childhood dreams of being a sports announcer by performing the play-by-play commentary in the video game ''NBA Ballers: Chosen One'' on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

In 2009, Ridenhour wrote the foreword to the book ''The Love Ethic: The Reason Why You Can't Find and Keep Beautiful Black Love'' by Kamau and Akilah Butler.  He also appeared on [[Brother Ali]]'s album, ''[[Us (Brother Ali album)|Us]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Williams, Kam |title=The Love Ethic |url=http://www.kamwilliams.com/2009/06/by-kamau-and-akilah-butler-foreword-by.html|date=June 30, 2009 |publisher=KamWilliams.com |accessdate=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Chuck D re-recorded vocals with [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]] for a cover of &quot;[[Fight the Power]]&quot;.

Chuck D duetted with Rock singer [[Meat Loaf]] on his 2011 album ''[[Hell in a Handbasket]]'' on the song &quot;Mad Mad World/The Good God Is a Woman and She Don't Like Ugly&quot;.

== Rapping technique and creative process ==
Chuck D is known for his powerful [[rapping]] voice - ''How to Rap'' says, “Chuck D of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] has a powerful, resonant voice that is often acclaimed as one of the most distinct and impressive in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]]”.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated248&quot;&gt;Edwards, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Chuck D says this was based on listening to [[Melle Mel]] and sportscasters such as Marv Albert.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated248&quot;/&gt;

Chuck D often comes up with a title for a song first&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Brian. ''[[Check the Technique: Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies]]''. New York: Villard/Random House, 2007, ISBN 978-0-8129-7775-2. p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he writes on paper, though he sometimes edits using a computer.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ZemzPXFgeEoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 143.]&lt;/ref&gt; He also prefers to not [[Punch in/out|punch in]] vocals,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; and he prefers to not [[overdub]] vocals.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Ridenhour is politically active; he co-hosted ''[[Unfiltered]]'' on [[Air America Radio]], testified before [[United States Congress|Congress]] in support of [[peer-to-peer]] MP3 sharing, and was involved in a 2004 rap political convention.  He continues to be an [[activism|activist]], publisher, lecturer, and producer. Addressing the negative views associated with rap music, he co-wrote the essay book ''Fight the Power: Rap, Race, and Reality'', along with Yusuf Jah. He argues that &quot;music and art and culture is escapism, and escapism sometimes is healthy for people to get away from reality&quot;, but sometimes the distinction is blurred and that's when &quot;things could lead a young mind in a direction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/04648327/chuck_d_the_d_is_for_dangerous.html |title=Chuck D: The D is for Dangerous |publisher=Crave Online |date=August 6, 2007 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded the record company Slam Jamz and acted as narrator in Kareem Adouard's short film ''Bling: Consequences and Repercussions'', which examines the role of [[conflict diamonds]] in [[bling]] fashion. Despite Chuck D and Public Enemy's success, Chuck D claims that popularity or public approval was never a driving motivation behind their work. He is admittedly skeptical of celebrity status, revealing in a 1999 interview with [[BOMB Magazine]] that, &quot;The key for the record companies is to just keep making more and more stars, and make the ones who actually challenge our way of life irrelevant. The creation of celebrity has clouded the minds of most people in America, Europe and Asia. It gets people off the path they need to be on as individuals.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, David. [http://bombsite.com/issues/68/articles/2251 &quot;Chuck D&quot;], ‘’[[BOMB Magazine]]’’ Summer, 1999. Retrieved on June 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[Le Monde]]'' published January 29, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2008/01/29/chuck-d-le-rap-sans-strass_1004960_3246.html#ens_id=1005052]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chuck D stated that rap is devolving so much into a commercial enterprise, that the relationship between the rapper and the record label is that of slave to a master.  He believes that nothing has changed for African-Americans since the debut of Public Enemy and, although he thinks that an Obama-Clinton alliance is great, he does not feel that the establishment will allow anything of substance to be accomplished. He also stated that French President Sarkozy is like any other European elite: he has profited through the murder, rape, and pillaging of those less fortunate and he refuses to allow equal opportunity for those men and women from Africa. In this article, he also defended a comment made by [[Professor Griff]] in the past that he says was taken out of context by the media. The real statement was a critique of the Israeli government and its treatment of the Palestinian people. Chuck D stated that it is Public Enemy's belief that all human beings are equal.

In an interview with the magazine ''N'Digo'' published in late June 2008, he spoke of today's mainstream urban music seemingly relishing the addictive euphoria of materialism and sexism, perhaps being the primary cause of many people harboring resentment towards the genre and its future. However he has expressed hope for its resurrection, saying &quot;It's only going to be dead if it doesn’t talk about the messages of life as much as the messages of death and non-movement&quot;, citing artists such as [[NYOil]], [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] and the [[The Roots]] as socially conscious artists who push the envelope creatively. &quot;A lot of cats are out there doing it, on the Web and all over. They’re just not placing their career in the hands of some major corporation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad, Cinque. &quot;[http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:1jc28ghXquEJ:www.ndigo.com/coverstory.asp+Chuck+D+N'DIGO&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;gl=uk Hip-Hop Conspiracy? Critics charge conscious rap is silenced.]&quot; ''N'Digo Online''. June 26 - July 2, 2008. Retrieved July 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently Chuck D became involved in ''Let Freedom Sing: The Music of the Civil Rights'', a 3-CD box set from Time Life.  He wrote the introduction to the liner notes and is visiting colleges across the nation discussing the significance of the set.  He's also set to appear in a follow up movie called ''Let Freedom Sing: The Music That Inspired the Civil Rights Movement''.

In 2010, Chuck D released a track entitled &quot;Tear Down That Wall&quot;. He said, “I talked about the wall not only just dividing the U.S. and Mexico but the states of California, New Mexico and Texas. But Arizona, it's like, come on. Now they're going to enforce a law that talks about basically racial profiling.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957694/chuck-d-takes-aim-at-arizona-public-enemy-in-the-studio|title=Chuck D Takes Aim at Arizona; Public Enemy In the Studio|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2009-09-14|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[film]] and [[video]], a '''cutaway shot''' is the interruption of a continuously filmed action by inserting a view of something else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary|publisher=The Art of the Guillotine|date=|url=http://www.artoftheguillotine.com/glossaryc.html|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually, although not always, followed by a cut back to the first shot, when the cutaway avoids a [[jump cut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Videography glossary|publisher=Calgary Board of Education|date=|url=http://schools.cbe.ab.ca/b690/Curriculum/computerop/comp9plus/CTS901-03/CTS9Plus-VideoGlossary.html|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cutaway shot does not necessarily contribute any dramatic content of its own, but is used to help the [[Film editing|editor]] assemble a longer sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cutaway|publisher=MediaCollege.com|date=|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/video/shots/cutaway.html|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, editors choose cutaway shots related to the main action, such as another action or object in the same location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Module 51|publisher=Cybercollege.com|date=|url=http://www.cybercollege.com/tvp051.htm|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the main shot is of a man walking down an alley, possible cutaways may include a shot of a cat on a nearby dumpster or a shot of a person watching from a window overhead.

Similarly, a '''cutaway scene''' is the interruption of a scene with the insertion of another scene, generally unrelated or only peripherally related to the original scene. The interruption is usually quick, and is usually, although not always, ended by a return to the original scene. The effect is of commentary to the original scene, frequently comic in nature.

==Usage==
The most common use of cutaway shots in dramatic films is to adjust the pace of the main action, to conceal the deletion of some unwanted part of the main shot, or to allow the joining of parts of two versions of that shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Grammar' of Television and Film|publisher=Aberystwyth University|date=|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/gramtv.html|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a scene may be improved by cutting a few [[Film frame|frames]] out of an actor's pause; a brief view of a listener can help conceal the break. Or the actor may fumble some of his lines in a group shot; rather than discarding a good version of the shot, the director may just have the actor repeat the lines for a new shot, and cut to that alternate view when necessary.

Cutaways are also used often in older horror films in place of special effects. For example, a shot of a zombie getting its head cut off may, for instance, start with a view of an axe being swung through the air, followed by a close-up of the actor swinging it, then followed by a cut back to the now severed head. [[George A. Romero]], creator of the [[Living Dead#Romero's Dead series|Dead Series]], and [[Tom Savini]] pioneered effects that removed the need for cutaways in horror films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Romero Surveys the Dead|publisher=Parallax view|date=|url=http://parallax-view.org/2008/10/29/george-romero-roams-the-land-of-the-dead/|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tom Savini biography|publisher=film reference|date=|url=http://www.filmreference.com/Writers-and-Production-Artists-Ro-She/Savini-Tom.html|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[news broadcasting]] and [[Documentary film|documentary work]], the cutaway is used much as it would be in fiction. On location, there is usually just one camera to film an interview, and it's usually trained on the interviewee. Often there is also only one microphone. After the interview, the interviewer will usually repeat his questions while he himself is being filmed, with pauses as they act as if to listen to the answers. These shots can be used as cutaways. Cutaways to the interviewer, called [[Noddy (TV interview technique)|noddies]], can also be used to cover cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Talk about Newsnight|publisher=The BBC|date=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/2007/08/faking_it.html|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Embroidery''' is the [[handicraft]] of decorating [[Textile|fabric]] or other materials with [[sewing needle|needle]] and [[yarn|thread or yarn]]. Embroidery may also incorporate other materials such as [[metal]] strips, [[pearl]]s, [[bead]]s, [[quill]]s, and  [[sequin]]s. Embroidery is most often used on caps, hats, coats, blankets, dress shirts, denim, stockings, and golf shirts. Embroidery is available with a wide variety of [[yarn|thread or yarn]] color.
[[File:17.17-37-1969-Kaukasisk-broderi.jpg|300px|thumbnail|[[Caucasus]] embroidery]]
An interesting characteristic of embroidery  is that the basic techniques or [[Embroidery stitch|stitches]] on surviving examples of the earliest embroidery—[[chain stitch]], [[buttonhole stitch|buttonhole or blanket stitch]], [[running stitch]], [[satin stitch]], [[cross stitch]]—remain the fundamental techniques of hand embroidery today.

==History==
Embroidery has been dated to the [[Warring States period]]
(5th-3rd century BC) of [[History of China|ancient China]].&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Bryan 1999, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;
The process used to tailor, patch, mend and reinforce cloth fostered the development of sewing techniques, and the decorative possibilities of sewing led to the art of embroidery.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Bryan 1999, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; In a garment from [[Migration period]] Sweden, roughly 300–700 CE, the edges of bands of trimming are reinforced with running stitch, back stitch, stem stitch, tailor's buttonhole stitch, and whipstitching, but it is uncertain whether this work simply reinforced the seams or should be interpreted as decorative embroidery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coatsworth&quot;&gt;Coatsworth, Elizabeth: &quot;Stitches in Time: Establishing a History of Anglo-Saxon Embroidery&quot;, in Netherton and Owen-Crocker 2005, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The remarkable stability of basic embroidery stitches has been noted:
{{blockquote|It is a striking fact that in the development of embroidery ... there are no changes of materials or techniques which can be felt or interpreted as advances from a primitive to a later, more refined stage. On the other hand, we often find in early works a technical accomplishment and high standard of craftsmanship rarely attained in later times.&lt;ref&gt;Marie Schuette and Sigrid Muller-Christensen, ''The Art of Embroidery'' translated by Donald King, Thames and Hudson, 1964, quoted in Netherton and Owen-Crocker 2005, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the 16th century, in the reign of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]], his chronicler [[Abu al-Fazl ibn Mubarak]] wrote in the famous [[Ain-i-Akbari]]:
&quot;His majesty (Akbar) pays much attention to various stuffs; hence [[Iran]]i, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], and [[Mongolia]]n articles of wear are in much abundance especially textiles embroidered in the patterns of ''Nakshi'', ''Saadi'', ''Chikhan'', ''Ari'', ''Zardozi'', ''Wastli'', ''Gota'' and ''Kohra''. The imperial workshops in the towns of [[Lahore]], [[Agra]], [[Fatehpur Sikri|Fatehpur]] and [[Ahmedabad]] turn out many masterpieces of workmanship in fabrics, and the figures and patterns, knots and variety of fashions which now prevail astonish even the most experienced travelers. Taste for fine material has since become general, and the drapery of embroidered fabrics used at feasts surpasses every description.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201104/mughal.maal.htm Saudi Aramco World : Mughal Maal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Embroidery was a very important art in the Medieval Islamic world.  One of the most interesting accounts of embroidery were given by the 17th century [[Turkish people|Turkish]] traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]], who called it the &quot;craft of the two hands&quot;. Because embroidery was a sign of high social status in Muslim societies, it became a hugely popular art. In cities such as [[Damascus]], [[Cairo]] and [[Istanbul]], embroidery was visible on [[handkerchief]]s, uniforms, flags, [[calligraphy]], shoes, [[robe]]s, tunics, horse trappings, slippers, sheaths, pouches, covers, and even on [[leather]] [[Belt (clothing)|belts]]. Many craftsmen embroidered with [[gold]] and [[silver]] thread.  A number of embroidery cottage industries, each employing over 800 people, grew to supply these items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200703/the.skill.of.the.two.hands.htm Saudi Aramco World : The Skill of the Two Hands&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaborately embroidered clothing, religious objects, and household items have been a mark of wealth and status in many cultures including ancient Persia, India, China, Japan, [[Byzantium]], and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] and [[Baroque]] [[Europe]]. Traditional folk techniques are passed from generation to generation in cultures as diverse as northern [[Vietnam]], [[Mexico]], and eastern [[Europe]]. Professional workshops and guilds arose in medieval [[England]]. The output of these workshops, called ''[[Opus Anglicanum]]'' or &quot;English work,&quot; was famous throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Levey and King 1993, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial Revolution==

The development of machine embroidery on a mass production scale came about in stages. The earliest machine embroidery used a combination of machine looms and teams of women embroidering the textiles by hand. This was done in France by the mid-1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Charles|title=Pictorial Gallery of Arts|year=1858|location=England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manufacture of [[St. Gallen Embroidery|machine-made embroideries]] in [[St. Gallen]] in eastern Switzerland flourished in the latter half of the 19th century.

Embroidery can be classified according to whether the design is stitched ''on top of'' or ''through'' the foundation fabric, and by the relationship of stitch placement to the fabric.

In free embroidery, designs are applied without regard to the weave of the underlying fabric.  Examples include [[crewel embroidery|crewel]] and traditional Chinese and Japanese embroidery.

[[Image:Cross stitch embroidery.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cross-stitch]] [[counted-thread embroidery]].  Tea-cloth, [[Hungary]], mid-20th century]]

[[Counted-thread embroidery]] patterns are created by making stitches over a predetermined number of threads in the foundation fabric. Counted-thread embroidery is more easily worked on an [[even-weave]] foundation fabric such as embroidery [[canvas]], [[aida cloth]], or specially woven [[cotton]] and [[linen]] fabrics although non-evenweave linen is used as well. Examples include [[needlepoint]] and some forms of [[blackwork embroidery]].
[[File:Hardanger embroidery.png|right|thumb|[[Hardanger embroidery|Hardanger]], a [[whitework]] technique. Contemporary.]]

In [[canvas work]] threads are stitched through a fabric mesh to create a dense pattern that completely covers the foundation fabric. Traditional canvas work such as [[Bargello (needlework)|bargello]] is a counted-thread technique.&lt;ref&gt;Gillow and Bryan 1999, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 19th century, printed and hand painted canvases, on which the printed or painted image serves as a guide to the placement of the various thread or yarn colors, have eliminated the need for counting threads.  These are particularly suited to pictorial rather than geometric designs such as those deriving from the [[Berlin wool work]] craze of the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Embroiderers' Guild 1984, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berman 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RDCW&quot;&gt;Readers Digest 1979, p. 112-115&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[drawn thread work]] and [[cutwork]], the foundation fabric is deformed or cut away to create holes that are then embellished with embroidery, often with thread in the same color as the foundation fabric.  These techniques are the forerunners of [[needlelace]].  When created with white thread on white linen or cotton, this work is collectively referred to as [[whitework]].&lt;ref&gt;Readers Digest 1979, pp. 74-91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
[[Image:Patiala Phulkari.jpg|thumb| [[Phulkari]] from the [[Punjab region]] of India. Phulkari embroidery, popular since at least the 15th century, is traditionally done on hand-spun cotton cloth with simple darning stitches using silk floss.]]
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene55 Eustach.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Laid threads, a surface technique in wool on linen. The [[Bayeux Tapestry]], 11th century.]]

The fabrics and yarns used in traditional embroidery vary from place to place. [[Wool]], [[linen]], and [[silk]] have been in use for thousands of years for both fabric and yarn.  Today, [[embroidery thread]] is manufactured in [[cotton]], [[rayon]], and [[novelty yarn]]s as well as in traditional wool, linen, and silk.  [[Ribbon]] embroidery uses narrow ribbon in silk or silk/[[organza]] blend ribbon, most commonly to create floral motifs.&lt;ref&gt;van Niekerk 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface embroidery techniques such as chain stitch and [[couching|couching or laid-work]] are the most economical of expensive yarns; couching is generally used for [[goldwork]].  Canvas work techniques, in which large amounts of yarn are buried on the back of the work, use more materials but provide a sturdier and more substantial finished textile.&lt;ref name=&quot;RDCW&quot; /&gt;

In both canvas work and surface embroidery an [[embroidery hoop]] or frame can be used to stretch the material and ensure even stitching tension that prevents pattern distortion. Modern canvas work tends to follow symmetrical counted stitching patterns with designs emerging from the repetition of one or just a few similar stitches in a variety of hues. In contrast, many forms of surface embroidery make use of a wide range of stitching patterns in a single piece of work.&lt;ref&gt;Readers Digest 1979, pp. 1-19, 112-117&lt;/ref&gt;

==Machine==
[[Image:Machine chain stitch.jpg|right|thumb|Commercial machine embroidery in [[chain stitch]] on a [[voile]] curtain, China, early 21st century.]]

Much contemporary embroidery is stitched with a [[computer]]ized embroidery machine using patterns &quot;digitized&quot; with [[embroidery software]]. In [[machine embroidery]], different types of &quot;fills&quot; add texture and design to the finished work. [[Machine embroidery]] is used to add [[logo]]s and [[monogram]]s to business shirts or jackets, gifts, and team apparel as well as to decorate household linens, draperies, and decorator fabrics that mimic the elaborate hand embroidery of the past.

In medicine, a '''coma''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κῶμα}} ''koma'', meaning &quot;deep sleep&quot;) is a state of unconsciousness lasting more than six hours in which a person: cannot be awakened; fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, or sound; lacks a normal sleep-wake cycle; and, does not initiate voluntary actions.&lt;ref name=RR&gt;{{cite book | author=Weyhenmyeye, James A.; Eve A. Gallman | title=Rapid Review Neuroscience 1st Ed | publisher=Mosby Elsevier | year=2007 | pages=177–9 | isbn=0-323-02261-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person in a state of coma is described as being '''comatose'''.

A comatose person exhibits a complete absence of wakefulness and is unable to consciously feel, speak, hear, or move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bordini|first=A.L.|author2=Luiz, T.F. |author3=Fernandes, M. |author4=Arruda, W. O. |author5= Teive, H. A. |title=Coma scales: a historical review|journal=Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria|year=2010|pages=930–937|doi=10.1590/S0004-282X2010000600019|volume=68|issue=6|pmid=21243255}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a patient to maintain consciousness, two important neurological components must function. The first is the [[cerebral cortex]]—the gray matter that covers the outer layer of the brain.  The other is a structure located in the brainstem, called [[reticular activating system]] (RAS).&lt;ref name=med&gt;{{cite book |author=Hannaman, Robert A.|title=MedStudy Internal Medicine Review Core Curriculum: Neurology 11th Ed|publisher=MedStudy| year=2005 |pages=(11–1) to (11–2) |isbn=1-932703-01-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Persistent vegetative state: A medical minefield|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=July 7, 2007|pages=40–3|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19526111.800-persistent-vegetative-state-a-medical-minefield.html?full=true}} See [http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/archive/2611/26111801.jpg diagram].&lt;/ref&gt;
Injury to either or both of these components is sufficient to cause a patient to experience a coma.  The cerebral cortex is a group of tight, dense, &quot;gray matter&quot; composed of the nuclei of the neurons whose axons then form the &quot;white matter&quot;, and is responsible for perception, relay of the sensory input (sensation) via the thalamic pathway, and many other neurological functions, including complex thinking.

RAS, on the other hand, is a more primitive structure in the brainstem that is tightly in connection with reticular formation (RF).  The RAS area of the brain has two tracts, the ascending and descending tract. Made up of a system of acetylcholine-producing neurons, the ascending track, or ascending reticular activating system (ARAS), works to arouse and wake up the brain, from the RF, through the thalamus, and then finally to the cerebral cortex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young 2009 32–47&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=G.B.|title=Coma|journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci|year=2009|issue=1157|pages=32–47|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04471.x|volume=1157|bibcode=2009NYASA1157...32Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A failure in ARAS functioning may then lead to a coma.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{multiple image|direction=horizontal|width=160|image1=Aaron in Coma1.jpg|caption1=Image of a man at beginning of documented 3-month coma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW8rBQgiU_c|title=Video of man at beginning of documented 3 month coma.}}&lt;/ref&gt;|image2=comaventilator.jpg|caption2=Image of the man still unresponsive to stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6t6dDEDVXg|title=Video of man still nonresponsive to stimuli while in coma.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Generally, a person who is unable to voluntarily open the eyes, does not have a sleep-wake cycle, is unresponsive in spite of strong tactile (painful), or verbal stimuli and who generally scores between 3 to 8&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glasgow Coma Scale|author=Russ Rowlett|publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/scales/glasgow.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] is considered in a coma.&lt;ref name=RR /&gt; Coma may have developed in humans as a response to injury to allow the body to pause bodily actions and heal the most immediate injuries - if at all - before waking. It therefore could be a compensatory state in which the body's expenditure of energy is not superfluous. The severity and mode of onset of coma depends on the underlying cause. For instance, severe [[hypoglycemia]] (low blood sugar) or [[hypercapnia]] (increased [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the blood) initially cause mild agitation and confusion, but progress to [[obtundation]], stupor and finally complete unconsciousness. In contrast, coma resulting from a severe [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] can be instantaneous. The mode of onset may therefore be indicative of the underlying cause.

===Causes  of coma===
Coma may result from a variety of conditions, including [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] (such as drug abuse, overdose or misuse of over the counter medications, prescribed medication, or controlled substances), [[metabolism|metabolic]] abnormalities, central nervous system diseases, acute neurologic injuries such as [[stroke]]s or [[herniation]]s, [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[hypothermia]], [[hypoglycemia]] or traumatic injuries such as [[head trauma]] caused by falls or [[vehicle collision]]s. It may also be deliberately [[induced coma|induced]] by pharmaceutical agents during major [[neurosurgery]], to preserve higher brain functions following [[brain trauma]], or to save the patient from extreme pain during healing of injuries or diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Induced Coma|author=Benjamin Werdro| url=http://www.medicinenet.com/coma/page8.htm#induced}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty percent of comatose states result from drug poisoning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liversedge 2010 337–339&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liversedge|author2=Hirsch|title=Coma|journal=Anaesthesia &amp;amp; Intensive Care Medicine|year=2010|pages=337–339|doi=10.1016/j.mpaic.2010.05.008|first1=Timothy|volume=11|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs damage or weaken the synaptic functioning in the ARAS and keep the system from properly functioning to arouse the brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young 2009 32–47&quot;/&gt;  Secondary effects of drugs, which include abnormal heart rate and blood pressure, as well as abnormal breathing and sweating, may also indirectly harm the functioning of the ARAS and lead to a coma. Seizures and hallucinations have shown to also play a major role in ARAS malfunction. Given that drug poisoning causes a large portion of patients in a coma, hospitals first test all comatose patients by observing pupil size and eye movement, through the vestibular-ocular reflex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young 2009 32–47&quot;/&gt;

The second most common cause of coma, which makes up about 25% of comatose patients, occurs from lack of oxygen, generally resulting from cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liversedge 2010 337–339&quot;/&gt; The Central Nervous System (CNS) requires a great deal of oxygen for its neurons. Oxygen deprivation in the brain, also known as hypoxia, causes neuronal extracellular sodium and calcium to decrease and intracellular calcium to increase, which harms neuron communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Busl|first=K. M.|author2=Greer, D. M.|title=Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury: Pathophysiology, neuropathology and mechanisms|journal=NeuroRehabilitation|year=2010|pages=5–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of oxygen in the brain also causes [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] exhaustion and cellular breakdown from cytoskeleton damage and nitric oxide production.

Twenty percent of comatose states result from the side effects of a stroke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Liversedge 2010 337–339&quot;/&gt; During a stroke, blood flow to part of the brain is restricted or blocked. An ischemic stroke, brain hemorrhage, or tumor may cause such cessation of blood flow. Lack of blood to cells in the brain prevents nutrients and oxygen from getting to the neurons, and consequently causes cells to become disrupted and eventually die. As brain cells die, brain tissue continues to deteriorate, which may affect functioning of the ARAS.

The remaining 15% of comatose cases result from trauma, excessive blood loss, malnutrition, hypothermia, hyperthermia, abnormal glucose levels, and many other biological disorders.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of coma is simple, but diagnosing the cause of the underlying disease process is often challenging. The first priority in treatment of a comatose patient is stabilization following the basic ABCs (standing for airway, breathing, and circulation). Once a person in a coma is stable, investigations are performed to assess the underlying cause. Investigative methods are divided into [[physical examination]] findings and imaging (such as [[Cat scan|CAT scan]], [[Mri|MRI]], etc.) and special studies ([[EEG]], etc.)

===Diagnostic steps===
When an unconscious patient enters a hospital, the hospital utilizes a series of diagnostic steps to identify the cause of unconsciousness. According to Young,&lt;ref name=&quot;Young 2009 32–47&quot;/&gt; the following steps should be taken when dealing with a patient possibly in a coma:
# Perform a general examination and medical history check
# Make sure the patient is in an actual comatose state and or is not in locked-in state (patient is either able to voluntarily move his eyes or blink) or psychogenic unresponsiveness ([[Caloric_reflex_test|caloric stimulation of the vestibular apparatus]] results in slow deviation of eyes towards the stimulation followed by rapid correction to mid-line. This response can't be voluntarily suppressed—so if the patient doesn't have this response, psychogenic coma can be ruled out.)
# Find the site of the brain that may be causing coma (i.e., brain stem, back of brain…) and assess the severity of the coma with the Glasgow coma scale
# Take blood work to see if drugs were involved or if it was a result of hypoventilation/hyperventilation
# Check for levels of “serum glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate, urea, and creatinine”
# Perform brain scans to observe any abnormal brain functioning using either CT or MRI scans
# Continue to monitor brain waves and identify seizures of patient using EEGs

===Initial assessment and evaluation===
In the initial assessment of coma, it is common to gauge the [[level of consciousness]] by spontaneously exhibited actions, response to vocal stimuli (&quot;Can you hear me?&quot;), and painful stimuli; this is known as the [[AVPU]] (alert, vocal stimuli, painful stimuli, unresponsive) scale. More elaborate scales, such as the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]], quantify an individual's reactions such as eye opening, movement and verbal response on a scale; Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is an indication of the extent of brain injury varying from 3 (indicating severe brain injury and death) to a maximum of 15 (indicating mild or no brain injury).

In those with deep unconsciousness, there is a risk of [[asphyxiation]] as the control over the muscles in the face and throat is diminished. As a result, those presenting to a hospital with coma are typically assessed for this risk (&quot;[[airway management]]&quot;). If the risk of asphyxiation is deemed high, doctors may use various devices (such as an [[oropharyngeal airway]], [[nasopharyngeal airway]] or [[endotracheal tube]]) to safeguard the airway.

===Physical examination findings===
[[File:Decorticate.PNG|thumb|[[Decorticate posturing]], indicating a [[lesion]] at the [[red nucleus]] or above. This positioning is stereotypical for upper [[brain stem]], or [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] damage. The other variant is [[Decerebrate posturing]], not seen in this picture.]]

Physical examination is critical after stabilization. It should include [[vital signs]], a general portion dedicated to making observations about the patient's [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] (breathing pattern), body movements (if any), and of the patient's [[body habitus]] (physique); it should also include assessment of the brainstem and cortical function through special reflex tests such as the [[oculocephalic reflex]] test (doll's eyes test), [[caloric reflex test|oculovestibular reflex]] test (cold caloric test), nasal tickle, [[corneal reflex]], and the [[gag reflex]].

Vital signs in medicine are temperature (rectal is most accurate), blood pressure, heart rate (pulse), respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. It should be easy to evaluate these vitals quickly to gain insight into a patient's metabolism, fluid status, heart function, vascular integrity, and tissue oxygenation.

Respiratory pattern (breathing rhythm) is significant and should be noted in a comatose patient. Certain stereotypical patterns of breathing have been identified including [[Cheyne-Stokes]] a form of breathing in which the patient's breathing pattern is described as alternating episodes of [[hyperventilation]] and [[apnea]]. This is a dangerous pattern and is often seen in pending herniations, extensive cortical lesions, or brainstem damage.&lt;ref name=med /&gt; Another pattern of breathing is [[apneustic breathing]], which is characterized by sudden pauses of [[Inhalation|inspiration]] and is due to a lesion of the [[pons]].&lt;ref name=RR /&gt;&lt;ref name=med /&gt; [[Ataxic respiration|Ataxic breathing]] is irregular and is due to a lesion (damage) of the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]].

Assessment of posture and body habitus is the next step. It involves general observation about the patient's positioning. There are often two stereotypical postures seen in comatose patients. [[Decorticate posturing]] is a stereotypical posturing in which the patient has arms [[Flexion|flexed]] at the elbow, and arms adducted toward the body, with both legs [[Extension (kinesiology)|extended]]. [[Decerebrate posturing]] is a stereotypical posturing in which the legs are similarly extended (stretched), but the arms are also stretched (extended at the elbow). The posturing is critical since it indicates where the damage is in the central nervous system. A decorticate posturing indicates a lesion (a point of damage) at or above the [[red nucleus]], whereas a decerebrate posturing indicates a lesion at or below the red nucleus. In other words, a decorticate lesion is closer to the cortex, as opposed to a decerebrate cortex that is closer to the brainstem.

[[Oculocephalic reflex]] also known as the doll's eye is performed to assess the integrity of the brainstem. Patient's eyelids are gently elevated and the cornea is visualized. The patient's head is then moved to the patient's left, to observe if the eyes stay or deviate toward the patient's right; same maneuver is attempted on the opposite side. If the patient's eyes move in a direction opposite to the direction of the rotation of the head, then the patient is said to have an intact brainstem. However, failure of both eyes to move to one side, can indicate damage or destruction of the affected side. In special cases, where only one eye deviates and the other does not, this often indicates a lesion (or damage) of the [[medial longitudinal fasciculus]] (MLF), which is a brainstem nerve tract. [[Caloric reflex test]] also evaluates both cortical and brainstem function; cold water is injected into one ear and the patient is observed for eye movement; if the patient's eyes slowly deviate toward the ear where the water was injected, then the brainstem is intact, however failure to deviate toward the injected ear indicates damage of the brainstem on that side. Cortex is responsible for a rapid [[nystagmus]] away from this deviated position and is often seen in patients who are conscious or merely lethargic.

An important part of the physical exam is also assessment of the [[cranial nerves]]. Due to the unconscious status of the patient, only a limited number of the nerves can be assessed. These include the cranial nerves number 2 (CN II), number 3 (CN III), number 5 (CN V), number 7 (CN VII), and cranial nerves 9 and 10 (CN IX, CN X). [[Gag reflex]] helps assess cranial nerves 9 and 10. Pupil reaction to light is important because it shows an intact retina, and cranial nerve number 2 (CN II); if pupils are reactive to light, then that also indicates that the cranial nerve number 3 (CN III) (or at least its [[parasympathetic]] fibers) are intact. [[Corneal reflex]] assess the integrity of cranial nerve number 7 (CN VII), and cranial nerve number 5 (CN V). Cranial nerve number 5 (CN V), and its ophthalmic branch (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) are responsible for the afferent arm of the reflex, and the cranial nerve number 7 (CN VII) also known a facial nerve, is responsible for the efferent arm, causing contraction of the muscle [[orbicularis oculi]] resulting in closing of the eyes.

Pupil assessment is often a critical portion of a comatose examination, as it can give information as to the cause of the coma; the following table is a technical, medical guideline for common pupil findings and their possible interpretations:&lt;ref name=med /&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Pupil sizes (Left eye vs. Right eye) !! Possible interpretation

|-
| [[File:Darkblue.jpg|250px]] || Normal eye with two pupils equal in size and reactive to light. This means that the patient is probably not in a coma and is probably lethargic, under influence of a drug, or sleeping.
|-
| [[File:Myosis due to opiate use.jpg|250px]] || &quot;Pinpoint&quot; pupils indicate [[heroin]] or opiate overdose, and can be responsible for a patient's coma. The pinpoint pupils are still reactive to light, [[wikt:bilateral|bilaterally]] (in both eyes, not just one). Another possibility is the damage of the pons.&lt;ref name=med /&gt;
|-
| [[File:Anizokoria.JPG|250px]] || One pupil is dilated and unreactive, while the other is normal (in this case the R eye is dilated but the L eye is normal in size). This could mean a damage to the [[oculomotor nerve]] (cranial nerve number 3, CN III) on the right side, or possibility of vascular involvement.
|-
| [[File:Cyclopentolate 1 percent Pupils.jpg|250px]] || Both pupils are dilated and unreactive to light. This could be due to overdose of certain medications, [[hypothermia]] or severe [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]] (lack of oxygen).

===Imaging and special tests findings===
Imaging basically encompasses [[computed tomography]] (CAT or CT) scan of the brain, or [[MRI]] for example, and is performed to identify specific causes of the coma, such as [[hemorrhage]] in the brain or [[herniation]] of the brain structures. Special tests such as an [[EEG]] can also show a lot about the activity level of the cortex such as semantic processing,&lt;ref name=Daltrozzo01&gt;Daltrozzo, J., Wioland, N., Mutschler, V., Lutun, P., Jaeger, A., Calon, B., Meyer, A., Pottecher, T., Lang, S., Kotchoubey, B. (2009c). Cortical Information Processing in Coma, Cognitive &amp; Behavioral Neurology, 22(1), 53-62.[http://daltrozzo.net78.net/papers/Daltrozzo_et_al_%202009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; presence of [[seizures]], and are important available tools not only for the assessment of the cortical activity but also for predicting the likelihood of the patient's awakening.&lt;ref name=Daltrozzo02&gt;Daltrozzo, J., Wioland, N., Mutschler, V., Kotchoubey, B. (2007). Predicting Coma and other Low Responsive Patients Outcome using Event-Related Brain Potentials: A Meta-analysis. Clinical Neurophysiology, 118, 606-614.[http://daltrozzo.net78.net/papers/daltrozzo_et_al_2007a.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The autonomous responses such as the [[skin conductance response]] may also provide further insight on the patient's emotional processing.&lt;ref name=Daltrozzo03&gt;Daltrozzo, J., Wioland, N., Mutschler, V., Lutun, P., Calon, B., Meyer, A., Jaeger, A., Pottecher, T., Kotchoubey, B. (2010a). Electrodermal Response in Coma and Other Low Responsive Patients. Neuroscience Letters, 475(1), 44-47.[http://daltrozzo.net78.net/papers/Daltrozzo_et_al_2010b.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
When diagnosing any neurological condition, history and examination are fundamental.  History is obtained by family, friends or EMS.  The [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] is a helpful system used to examine and determine the depth of coma, track patients progress and predict outcome as best as possible. In general a correct diagnosis can be achieved by combining findings from physical exam, imaging, and history components and directs the appropriate therapy.

===Severity and classification===
{{Main|Coma scale}}
A coma can be classified as (1) [[Tentorium cerebelli|supratentoral]] (above [[Tentorium cerebelli]]), (2) [[Tentorium cerebelli|infratentoral]] (below Tentorium cerebelli), (3) metabolic or (4) diffused.&lt;ref name=med /&gt; This classification is merely dependent on the position of the original damage that caused the coma, and does not correlate with severity or the prognosis.
The severity of coma impairment however is categorized into several levels. Patients may or may not progress through these levels. In the first level, the brain responsiveness lessens, normal reflexes are lost, the patient no longer responds to pain and cannot hear.

The [[Rancho Los Amigos Scale]] is a complex scale that has eight separate levels, and is often used in the first few weeks or months of coma while the patient is under closer observation, and when shifts between levels are more frequent.

==Treatment==

===Medical treatment===
The treatment hospitals use on comatose patients depends on both the severity and cause of the comatose state. Although the best treatment for comatose patients remains unknown, hospitals usually place comatose patients in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young 2009 32–47&quot;/&gt; In the ICU, the hospital monitors a patient’s breathing and brain activity through CT scans. Attention must first be directed to maintaining the patient's respiration and circulation, using intubation and ventilation, administration of intravenous fluids or blood and other supportive care as needed. Once a patient is stable and no longer in immediate danger, the medical staff may concentrate on maintaining the health of patient’s physical state.  The concentration is directed to preventing infections such as pneumonias, bedsores ([[decubitus ulcers]]), and providing balanced nutrition.&lt;ref name=sr /&gt; These infections may appear from the patient not being able to move around, and being confined to the bed.  The nursing staff moves the patient every 2–3 hours from side to side and depending on the state of consciousness sometimes to a chair.  The goal is to move the patient as much as possible to try to avoid bedsores, [[atelectasis]] and pneumonia.  Pneumonia can occur from the person’s inability to swallow leading to [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]], lack of gag reflex or from feeding tube, ([[aspiration pneumonia]]). Physical therapy may also be used to prevent [[contractures]] and orthopedic deformities that would limit recovery for those patients who emerge from coma.

A person in a coma may become restless, or seize and need special care to prevent them from hurting themselves.  Medicine may be given to calm such individuals.  Patients who are restless may also try to pull on tubes or dressings so soft cloth wrist restraints may be put on.  Side rails on the bed should be kept up to prevent the patient from falling.&lt;ref name=sr&gt;{{cite web|title=Coma| url=http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/PatientEd/Materials/PDFDocs/dis-cond/general/coma.pdf|accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In attempt to wake comatose patients, some hospitals treat their patients by either reversing the cause of comatose (i.e., glucose shock if low sugar), giving medication to stop brain swelling, or inducing hypothermia. Inducing hypothermia on comatose patients provides one of the main treatments for patients after suffering from cardiac arrest. In this treatment, medical personnel expose patients to “external or intravascular cooling” at 32-34 °C for 24 h.; this treatment cools patients down about 2-3 °C less than normal body temperature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baldursdottir 2010 821–826&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldursdottir|first=S.|author2=Sigvaldason, K. |author3=Karason, S. |author4=Valsson, F. |author5= Sigurdsson, G. H. |title=Induced hypothermia in comatose survivors of asphyxia: a case series of 14 consecutive cases|journal=Acta Anaesthesiol. Scand.|year=2010|pages=821–826|doi=10.1111/j.1399-6576.2010.02248.x|volume=54|issue=7|pmid=20497127}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Baldursdottir and her coworkers&lt;ref name=&quot;Baldursdottir 2010 821–826&quot;/&gt; found that in the hospital, more comatose patients survived after induced hypothermia than patients that remained at normal body temperature. For this reason, the hospital chose to continue the induced hypothermia technique for all of its comatose patients that suffered from cardiac arrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baldursdottir 2010 821–826&quot;/&gt;

===Emotional challenges===
Coma has a wide variety of emotional reactions from the family members of the affected patients, as well as the primary care givers taking care of the patients. Common reactions, such as desperation, anger, frustration, and denial are possible. The focus of the patient care should be on creating an amicable relationship with the family members or dependents of a comatose patient as well as creating a rapport with the medical staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caring for Care Giver and Family|author=Coma Care|date=2010-03-30|accessdate=2010-12-08|url=http://www.comacare.com/cgi-bin/giga.cgi?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
Comas can last from several days to several weeks. In more severe cases a coma may last for over five weeks, while some have lasted as long as several years. After this time, some patients gradually come out of the coma, some progress to a [[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative state]], and others die. Some patients who have entered a vegetative state go on to regain a degree of awareness. Others remain in a vegetative state for years or even decades (the longest recorded period being 42 years).&lt;ref&gt;Edwarda O’Bara, who spent 4 decades in a coma, dies at 59

The outcome for coma and vegetative state depends on the cause, location, severity and extent of neurological damage. A deeper coma alone does not necessarily mean a slimmer chance of recovery, because some people in deep coma recover well while others in a so-called milder coma sometimes fail to improve.

People may emerge from a coma with a combination of physical, intellectual and psychological difficulties that need special attention. Recovery usually occurs gradually—patients acquire more and more ability to respond. Some patients never progress beyond very basic responses, but many recover full awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Coma Information Page: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)|author=NINDS| date= October 29, 2010|accessdate= 2010-12-08|url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/coma/coma.htm#What_is_the_prognosis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regaining consciousness is not instant: in the first days, patients are only awake for a few minutes, and duration of time awake gradually increases. This is unlike the situation in many movies where people who awake from comas are instantly able to continue their normal lives. In reality, the coma patient awakes sometimes in a profound state of confusion, not knowing how they got there and sometimes suffering from [[dysarthria]], the inability to articulate any speech, and with many other disabilities.

Predicted chances of recovery are variable owing to different techniques used to measure the extent of neurological damage. All the predictions are based on [[statistical]] rates with some level of chance for recovery present: a person with a low chance of recovery may still awaken. Time is the best general predictor of a chance of recovery: after four months of coma caused by [[brain damage]], the chance of partial recovery is less than 15%, and the chance of full recovery is very low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Formisano R |title=Clinical predictors and neuropleropsychological outcome in severe traumatic brain injury patients |journal=Acta Neurochir (Wien)|volume=146 |issue=5 |pages=457–62 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15118882 |doi=10.1007/s00701-004-0225-4 |url=|author2= Carlesimo GA |author3= Sabbadini M |author4=and others |displayauthors=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common cause of death for a person in a vegetative state is secondary [[infection]] such as [[pneumonia]], which can occur in patients who lie still for extended periods.

There are reports of patients coming out of coma after long periods of time. After 19 years in a [[minimally conscious state]], [[Terry Wallis]] spontaneously began speaking and regained awareness of his surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/07/11/1057783356390.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Mother stunned by coma victim's unexpected words | date=2003-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Poland|Polish]] railroad worker [[Jan Grzebski]] woke up from a 19-year coma in 2007.

A brain-damaged man, trapped in a coma-like state for six years, was brought back to consciousness in 2003 by doctors who planted electrodes deep inside his brain. The method, called [[deep brain stimulation]] (DBS) successfully roused communication, complex movement and eating ability in the 38-year-old American man who suffered a traumatic brain injury. His injuries left him in a [[minimally conscious state]] (MCS), a condition akin to a coma but characterized by occasional, but brief, evidence of environmental and self-awareness that coma patients lack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Electrodes stir man from six-year coma-like state |url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/node/1513 |work=Cosmos Magazine |date=2 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comas lasting seconds to minutes result in [[post-traumatic amnesia]] (PTA) that lasts hours to days; recovery plateau occurs over days to weeks.
Comas that last hours to days result in PTA lasting days to weeks; recovery plateau occurs over months.
Comas lasting weeks result in PTA that lasts months; recovery plateau occurs over months to years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorylossonline.com/glossary/posttraumaticamnesia.html|title=Post-traumatic amnesia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Research by Dr. Eelco Wijdicks on the depiction of comas in movies was published in Neurology in May 2006. Dr. Wijdicks studied 30 films (made between 1970 and 2004) that portrayed actors in prolonged comas, and he concluded that only two films accurately depicted the state of a coma victim and the agony of waiting for a patient to awaken: ''[[Reversal of Fortune]]'' (1990) and ''[[The Dreamlife of Angels]]'' (1998). The remaining 28 were criticized for portraying miraculous awakenings with no lasting side effects, unrealistic depictions of treatments and equipment required, and comatose patients remaining muscular and tanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{
